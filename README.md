# 1. Dashboard_master_projects
When I was doing my master's in Data Science, I worked on two dashboard projects in collaboration with other students. They were created in Python Dash and Plotly, with data extracted from APIs, cleaned, and transformed to be used in the dashboards.

# 2. Technologies Used

- **Python Dash** → chosen because it provides an interactive web-based dashboard framework.

- **Plotly** → used for creating dynamic and visually appealing charts.

- **APIs** → data was extracted from APIs to ensure real-time or up-to-date datasets.

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation (Pandas, NumPy)** → applied to standardize, filter, and shape the data for visualization.

## Why these technologies?
They allow rapid development of interactive dashboards, integration with external data sources, and flexible visual exploration.

# 3. Process and Methodology

- **Defining the Question**: What insight can be gained from These dashboard?

- **Data Extraction**: Pulling structured/unstructured data via APIs. This ensured that the dataset was current and reliable.

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Removing inconsistencies and shaping the data so it could be analyzed effectively.

- **Dashboard Development**: Implemented interactive charts, filters, and KPIs in Dash/Plotly to answer the guiding question.

## Why this process?
This structured approach ensured data quality, reproducibility, and that the final dashboard provided clear answers to the research question.

# 4. Results / Dashboard Purpose

- Created interactive dashboards that visualize content from a the website The Guardian and the other from Gender pay gab in Denmark.

- Allowed users to explore trends, compare categories, and generate insights in real time.
