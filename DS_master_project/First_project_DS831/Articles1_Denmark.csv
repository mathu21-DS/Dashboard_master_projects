article1,"Autumn in Denmark, and the woodsman’s on his way",2022-09-25 05:00:24,"['Gardening advice', 'Life and style', 'Gardens']","We leave Denmark with the leaves falling. The rowan is reddening, berries and branches. The cherry trees turning like in a watercolour painting. Autumn’s gathering on the ground. Bo, the woodsman, is coming. There are dividing trees to be trimmed. Many haven’t been touched in years. We are negotiating with our neighbour. They want the wood taken away. We want branches thicker than a forearm kept for next year’s winter fires. We will pay the premium. Bo is also here, though, to look at another corner of the plot. Most trees will be left alone, some trimmed, some taken. We are looking to gauge light density; to give smaller ones a chance. Bo has an eye for these things. Some we once bought from a local newspaper ad: all the saplings you can take from a field for 50 kroner (£5). Pines, fir, larch; some are now around 10m tall and too close together. There needs to be an intervention. Bo reads how green is the leaf on the birch and beech, and makes almost gentle suggestions. The heavy work will be done while we are away. Wood will be left by the shed for sawing and splitting over Christmas. Henri will stack it. She has an architect’s eye. This is long-term gardening, so slow you adjust to see it. Meanwhile, we work in the meadow. We rake and gather. We leave to seed. We try to address badger damage, and we reseed bare patches. We straighten nesting boxes. Autumn is undeniable now. Danish cold is coming. Just time to take a last walk along the coast; to gather fat rosehips, sweet blackberries, our pears. Henri will return soon with the girls, for bike rides and the annual apple festival, and to buy heather honey from the west coast. As we’re about to leave, the first skein of geese arrives, screeching winter on the wing. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

article2,"How to cycle to Iceland, part one: pedalling through Denmark",2022-09-24 09:00:04,"['Denmark holidays', 'Scandinavia holidays', 'Cycling holidays', 'Europe holidays', 'Cycling', 'Life and style', 'Travel']","A week before departure everything is ready: the polished bicycle laden with four carefully packed panniers, the ferry and train journeys all booked, the accommodation and campsites reserved. Cycling to Iceland is a complex business: ferry to Amsterdam from Newcastle, trains to Aarhus, cycle up through Jutland to the port of Hirtshals, close to the northern tip of Denmark, ferries onward to the Faroe Islands, which I will explore by bicycle before embarking for more cycling around the east of Iceland. Three weeks in total and no flights involved. One small sacrifice for the climate emergency, but also a chance to alert everyone to the wonderful adventures that can be had without flying. But four days before departure, I find myself in hospital staring at a very sick person who cannot be left. Weeks of planning and preparation are in jeopardy. Departure day passes, but then the miracle of intravenous antibiotics happens and I realise I can still travel, catching up with my own itinerary if I make a few changes. I must abandon the idea of taking my own bike, using rented machines instead; I must also leave immediately, and – gulp – take one short flight. I hurriedly stuff a few things inside two of the panniers and fly hand-luggage-only to Denmark. From the airport, I take trains and buses to the Jutland town of Thisted, where I rent a Dutch-style town bike with pedal brake. I load the panniers and my handlebar bag, then set off into the rolling empty countryside towards the coast, and some dark clouds. It feels good to be under way. Planning a no-fly international trip by bike is a lot more difficult than it ought to be. Ferry routes have been slashed in recent years – the trip would be far simpler if any ferry between the UK and Scandinavia still existed. Not only that but taking bikes on international trains can be frustratingly tricky (regional services are far easier). Our transport systems are hopeless when it comes to doing right by the planet. As I finally approach the Jutland coast, I run headlong into a vicious north-westerly gale that brings icy salvoes of rain straight off the North Sea. Any optimism is quickly washed out of me. I reach Hanstholm campsite (two-bed cabin from £63 a night) in twilight, soaked, shivering and hating bicycles. All the camping equipment is back at home. I take a small chalet. I unpack. I pull out a down jacket and gloves. How did they get in there? Stupid items to pack in a heatwave, but I pull them on gratefully. I’ve brought the wrong bag. But what’s this? A copy of War and Peace, the book I had been reading and intended to leave behind. I open at a random page and start reading. Tolstoy’s masterpiece is probably the most poignant read I could have chosen: the story of how everyone participates in a pointless stampede to predictable ruin. Even my tiny no-fly contribution has already misfired. When I wake next morning, things do not seem so bleak. The sun is shining in a blue sky as I cycle across grass towards a roaring sea. Denmark’s West Coast cycle path is 450 miles of dunes, woods and side roads, but that morning all I want is beach. Without consulting the map – the one I’ve left in the UK – I ride on to the sand and turn north. By keeping to the edge of the waves I can make decent progress, unless I try to turn, which makes me fall off. A cloud of curlews rises to my right, the wind holding the birds so close I feel I could reach out and stroke their long curved bills. The sea thunders in my ears and I stop thinking about anything. I love cycling. I love Denmark. When the tide eventually pushes me into the softer sand, I’m forced inland on to the grassy dunes, where I find a marked trail. A string of black diamonds discarded on the path suddenly uncurls and slithers away into the beds of wild snapdragons and orchids. This is adder territory. At Thorup Strand, I find a fishing collective that sells excellent fish and chips. By late afternoon I’m in Svinkløv campsite (tent for two for £47) where my fixed tent has a very comfortable bed. I love the understated, commonsense mentality of Denmark. There’s no fuss, no mess and certainly no hyperbole. When King Frederick VI came here in the early 19th century, he declared it the most beautiful part of his empire (which at the time included Norway, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroes, a trio of Caribbean islands, the Nicobar Islands and the Bengali city of Frederiknagore, now Serampore). There is nothing showy or spectacular, only some tidy meadows, a thatched windmill and a long beach. There are simple sleeping huts along this coastal trail, where I had planned to camp, but now I ride past. In the town of Blokhus, having lunch at the thatched Restaurant Futten, I drop into conversation with an 82-year-old doctor whose practice was once in Greenland, and his son. “I loved doing home visits,” he recalls, “I’d go by dog sled.” In summer he would come back here, to the family’s summer holiday home. I imagine a weatherboarded cabin filled with bits of driftwood and the skulls of sea creatures. Suddenly I feel a connection to my onward route, the vast northern seas salted with craggy volcanic outcrops and ice caps. For the first time I sense the benefits of arriving slowly over land and sea. There is time to talk and build knowledge and expectations. The doctor’s son talks about the egalitarian nature of the Danes. “When a group of ninth-century Viking warriors were asked who their leader was, they replied: ‘We’re all leaders’.” He asks whether I like the flat landscape. “For us Danes, the wilderness is not mountains, but sea.” I carry on up the beach, following the wavy line of spume to Løkken and what proves to be a top-notch B&amp;B, Villa Vendel (doubles from £104) in a lovely old-fashioned house with a bike store in the former stables. From here, in spitting rain again, I push the bike over a headland and into the spectacular remains of second world war German gun emplacements. The sea is tugging them down, slowly drowning them. Before too long, their dark corridors will be fish nurseries. Apart from occasional deep loops inland, I am almost always within sound of the sea on this journey and whenever I can, I ride on the beach. In places cars are allowed and the sand is churned up, but I can always find firm going by the water’s edge. Sometimes I carry the bike into the dunes and lie down out of the wind, watching birds and flowers, then go for a swim. To get dry, I stand in the wind. No towel. I buy open sandwiches and coffee at neatly painted clapboard cafes. I reach the port of Hirtshals on the night before the weekly ferry for the Faroes departs, checking in to the Montra Hotel (doubles from £90) close to the quay. The town itself is a strapping, seaworthy kind of place, where you could buy a fishing rod and a knife as well as trousers, socks, water bottles and towels. But I don’t. No space. My son Conor, who lives in Berlin, arrives by train to accompany me, and in the morning we set off in sunshine, walking towards the towering boat, Smyril Line’s Norröna, that has appeared. We will hire bikes when we arrive in Tórshavn, but I know little more than that: cycling is said to be new to the Faroes. On the quayside I chat to a Faroese crewman: “I do own a bike,” he tells me. “But I’ve never ridden it. People don’t ride bikes in the Faroes. It’s too cold, too windy and we have many long, dark tunnels.” We board the ferry with some excitement spiced with a little trepidation. After the gentle charms of Jutland, it seems, the epic bike ride is about to get significantly tougher. The trip was provided by Visit Nordvestkysten and Visit Denmark. Bike Havs in Løkken rents bicycles from £13.50 a day (ebikes from £22), with pick-ups and drop-offs around Jutland. DFDS ferries sails from Newcastle to Amsterdam daily. A Eurail “four days in a month” pass costs about £200. Smyril Line sails weekly in autumn from Hirtshals to Tórshavn in the Faroes, passenger with bicycle from £80 one way"
article3,EU adopts Ukrainian art exhibition left stranded in Denmark,2022-07-20 11:15:19,"['Ukraine', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Art', 'Museums', 'Art and design', 'Exhibitions', 'Culture', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin']","A Ukrainian exhibition that was left stranded in a gallery in Denmark unable to return to Kyiv when Russia invaded has reopened in Brussels after being adopted by the EU. The Unfolding Landscapes show, which includes paintings, sculptures, installations, drawings, photography and video, could not return to Ukraine and risked being locked away when its Danish run ended. A solution was found during four weeks of frenetic negotiations between curators, officials in the EU’s foreign policy wing, the European external action service, and the Art and History Museum in Brussels. Made and curated by 42 Ukrainian artists before Vladimir Putin’s February invasion, the show includes works that give a sense of foreboding. It will now stay in the Belgian capital’s premier art museum until 18 September, after which there are tentative plans for it to move to Switzerland. EU officials are looking at circulating the exhibition around some of the 27 member states until the pieces may safely return home, in what officials and curators said would be a highly symbolic moment. At the exhibition’s opening on Tuesday, Ukraine’s ambassador to the EU, Vsevolod Chentsov, said that in adopting the exhibition the EU had “brought this new spirit of quick effective decisions into the art world”, in a nod to the bloc’s speedy imposition of economic sanctions on Russia. “I hope this project has a big European future,” he said. “It starts in Belgium in Brussels in the heart of the EU, and I know that there are ideas about how it can continue and I hope, I’m sure, we will be able to do it.” Many of the artists whose works are showcased are involved in the Ukrainian war effort in cities such as Kharkiv close to the frontline in the north-east of the country, according to the curator Natalia Matsenko, who travelled from Kyiv for the Belgian opening. “I don’t know if any of the artists are fighting but I know some have the intention to do so,” she said. “This is a war and the whole nation is involved. It is not the military over there but the whole country is volunteering now.” The Ukrainian-Danish artist Sergei Sviatchenko, a celebrated part of the Ukrainian new wave art movement that emerged at the time of the collapse of the USSR, was a key figure in the organisation of the original exhibition in the Silkeborg Bad Art Center in Denmark, which ran until May. Sviatchenko, 70, said that when it became clear that the original plan for the works to return to Kyiv was impractical he had the idea that it could travel around Europe in a continuation of what he described as his life’s work of “cultural diplomacy”. “Perhaps it can also go to London. That would be special, I think,” Sviatchenko said. Most of the artists showcased are of a younger generation born as citizens of the USSR, but who were teenagers when Ukraine declared itself an independent country in 1991. They are said in the exhibition’s brochure to have had first-hand experience of the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, which condemned the totalitarian Communist and Nazi regimes, and began the decommunisation of modern Ukraine. The 2014 revolution brought the ousting of the then pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. One video on show by Yuri Yefanov, an artist who was born in Zaporizhzhia near today’s front-line, was filmed in 2013 on a beach on the southern coast of Crimea, where the artist grew up. Its focus is a concrete cube that was once part of the coastal defences. Today the area is impossible to visit as it is the site of a Russian military academy. Russia invaded and occupied Crimea in 2014."
article4,Margrethe II of Denmark marks jubilee as Europe’s only reigning queen,2022-09-11 13:23:14,"['Denmark', 'Queen Elizabeth II', 'Europe', 'Monarchy', 'UK news', 'World news']","Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, Europe’s longest serving monarch and only reigning queen after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, has marked her jubilee with a series of low-key celebrations in a show of respect for her third cousin. Margrethe, 82, an immensely popular monarch known for her artistic streak as well as her chain-smoking, is said to have made the decision herself. She had originally been due to mark the 50th anniversary of her accession to the Danish throne in January, but festivities were considerably scaled back because of the pandemic. Full-blown celebrations had been expected to take place across the country this weekend instead, but were then toned down again after the death of Queen Elizabeth on Thursday. The palace said that the decision was taken “at the Queen’s own request”, Danish media reported. In a letter of condolence to King Charles III, Margrethe called Queen Elizabeth “a towering figure among the European monarchs and a great inspiration to us all. We shall miss her terribly.” A carriage procession through the streets of Copenhagen, as well as a balcony appearance were cancelled. “After 50 years on the throne, Queen Margrethe is now the longest-serving living monarch in the world after Queen Elizabeth’s death,” the Danish newspaper Berlingske declared on Friday. Margrethe was crowned queen at the age of 31 on 14 January 1972. At the time of her accession, only 45% of Danes were in favour of the royal family, objecting to the place it held in a modern democracy. Today it enjoys the support of more than 80% of the population. Margrethe, who was widowed in 2018, is credited with modernising the institution and encouraged the marriage of two of her sons to non-nobility. She is praised for having remained scandal-free and non-political. Margrethe has repeatedly said she will remain on the throne until she dies. In 2019 she told the Swedish daily Expressen: “I intend to remain in place as long as I live. My mission is lifelong.” She said abdication would only come into question if she became seriously ill. Her son, Crown Prince Frederik, 54, is due to succeed her. Her fun-loving reputation was reinforced in May this year, when she rode on a rollercoaster at Copenhagen’s Tivoli amusement park, managing to keep her hat on. She is considered a skilled visual artist, having illustrated several books and had her works exhibited in museums at home and abroad. She has also worked as a costume and set designer with the Royal Danish Ballet and Royal Danish Theatre. Margrethe, a linguist, has also participated in translation projects, including a 1981 translation of Simone de Beauvoir’s All Men are Mortal, under a pseudonym. The decision to cancel street parties and a folk festival due to take place on Saturday was made by the royal family. The Queen had been due to appear on the balcony at Amalienborg Palace with members of her family, before taking a ceremonial carriage ride down Strøget Street in the centre of Copenhagen to City Hall. A gala performance at the Royal Theatre went ahead “in an adjusted form”, according to the palace. Members of the Swedish and Norwegian royal families were participating in the events at the weekend, including a church service on Sunday in Our Lady’s church in Copenhagen followed by a lunch on the Royal Yacht Dannebrog and a dinner at Christiansborg Palace. The historian Lars Hovbakke Sørensen told Berlingske even though the ties between the families “had not been so close”, the cancellation followed protocol. “It would send the wrong signal out to the world if you were to hold street festivals,” he said. “It’s necessary to show your sympathy not least because there are both personal and familial ties between the two royal families.” The second-longest-serving monarch is King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, who has been on the throne for 49 years. The Sultan of Brunei has been on the throne for 54 years, but opinions are divided as to whether he should be considered the world’s longest serving monarch, due to the fact that the country only became independent from Britain in 1984."
article5,Denmark offers ‘loss and damage’ funding to poorer countries for climate breakdown,2022-09-21 17:09:26,"['Climate crisis', 'Environment', 'Cop27', 'Denmark', 'Europe']","Youth groups in Africa are preparing to embark on a series of climate demonstrations on Friday to highlight the problem of “loss and damage” to poor countries blighted by climate breakdown, as only one rich country has so far stepped up with funding for the problem. Actions will take place on Friday in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with more to follow in some other African nations over the weekend. Denmark became the first central government of a developed country to propose funding devoted to “loss and damage” – which refers to those ravages of climate-related disasters which are so extreme that no protection against them is possible. At the UN general assembly, for which world leaders are converging on New York this week, the Danish government announced to philanthropists and poor countries that it would provide DKK 100m (£12m) specifically for loss and damage. Scotland has also offered funds for loss and damage, pledging £2m at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, and the government of the Belgian region of Wallonia pledged €1m (£0.9m) towards administration. Denmark is the first central or federal government to make a dedicated pledge. The sums are tiny compared with the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of losses that countries are expected to experience, but the symbolism is important. At Cop26, governments agreed to forge a framework to address loss and damage, but there was no agreement on a funding mechanism. Carolina Cecilio, of the climate thinktank E3G, said: “Denmark’s announcement is good news. It sends the right political signal and could incentivise other countries to follow. [It] is a step in the right direction, and further adds to the momentum on loss and damage. Now we just need more countries to follow with finance commitments, and be serious about supporting the people in need.” There are still question marks over how the Danish finance would work, and some campaigners and experts are concerned that some of it appears earmarked for insurance schemes rather than representing direct aid. Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica’s ministry of economic growth, said: “Jamaica is happy to see a developed nation stepping up to the plate and acknowledging the absolute need for loss and damage to be acknowledged. It is our hope that this will pave the way for commitments from other developed nations. Though $13m will not cover the vast devastation we are already experiencing from climatic events, I wish to thank Denmark for getting the ball rolling.” No other developed countries have indicated they are likely to follow the Danish lead. G7 governments may be more inclined to provide finance to the “global shield” initiative backed by Germany, as president of the G7 this year. The global shield is intended to provide funds for poor countries to gain resilience against the damages of extreme weather, for instance through providing the finance needed for developing countries to fulfil their “preparedness plans”, and could also involve a system of insurance against climate-related disasters. The loose definitions of the global shield mean that future funding related to the initiative could also be tagged as “loss and damage” funding, noted Cecilio. Even if no other countries step up at the UN general assembly, they will face increasing pressure in all climate forums to address loss and damage. The youth protests scheduled for this Friday, as world leaders fly home from New York, are the prelude to a sustained push on the issue. Developing countries were unsatisfied by the meagre attention paid to loss and damage at Cop26, where the focus was on rich-country pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They see their next big chance at the Cop27 UN climate conference, in Egypt in November. “Cop27 must act decisively on loss and damage to reinforce the collective commitment to leaving no one behind,” said Yamide Dagnet, director of climate justice at the Open Society Foundations. She pointed to the floods in Pakistan as an example of loss and damage that rich countries need to address. “In a single day, a third of Pakistan was inundated and more people than Canada’s entire population were affected. When you wipe out an entire agricultural area, you set back already vulnerable people by decades.” With an eye to the Cop27 discussions, a group of island governments have formed a new initiative, called Rising Nations, launched at UNGA on Wednesday, to prepare for the worst. Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands called for “a global settlement that guarantees their nation states a permanent existence beyond the inhabitable lifetimes of their atolls”. At Cop27, countries will be asked to consider new global taxes as a way of funding loss and damage payments. António Guterres, UN secretary-general, called at the UN general assembly for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to provide the cash needed. A leaked discussion paper, seen by the Guardian, prepared by developing countries, also raised the possibility of a global tax, on carbon emissions or air travel, to provide the funds needed. An alternative is for existing development institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to corral money from donor nations. The vital issue must be to ensure a flow of cash to where it is needed, according to Carlos Fuller, Belize’s representative to the UN. “Loss and damage is already occurring in Belize,” he said. “Severe erosion is altering communities, drought and floods affecting farmers and causing infrastructure damage, coral bleaching, and salt water intrusion is affecting the water supply. These impacts undermine our people’s quality of life and the lifeblood of our economy. A financial mechanism for loss and damage must be established at Cop27 to provide support to the communities that did little to cause this crisis.”"

article7,Denmark 0-1 Spain: Women’s Euro 2022 – as it happened,2022-07-16 21:05:07,"[""Women's Euro 2022"", ""Women's football"", ""Denmark women's football team"", ""Spain women's football team"", 'Football', 'Sport']","Sid Lowe’s match report has landed, so I’ll leave you with that. And if you’re near London tomorrow, why not join Sid and Phil Kitromilides for their Spanish Football Podcast live show? Thanks for your company tonight, bye! Denmark go out with honour, having produced their best performance of the tournament. They defended heroically and threatened as best they could on the break, with Pernille Harder outstanding. Ultimately, Spain were just too good. Mariona and Bonmati were influential throughout, while the half-time substitutes Carmona and Cardona had a big impact even before they combined for the winning goal. Peep peep! Spain will play England in Brighton on Wednesday after a nervy but ultimately deserved victory at the Brentford Community Stadium. They kept Denmark at arm’s length for most of the match, passing the ball with their usual style and precision, and Marta Cardona’s last-minute goal confirmed their place in the last eight. Mariona kept possession on the left and waited for the overlapping Carmona, who has been such a threat since coming on at half-time. She arrowed a deep cross to Cardona, who guided an accomplished header back across Christensen. Spain are into the quarter-finals! 89 min Stine Larsen is booked for dissent. 88 min Spain are a few minutes away from the quarter-finals. In truth, for all their endeavour, Denmark haven’t really looked like scoring in the second half. 86 min Sanne Troelsgaard shoots over from 30 yards. That was a poor decision at a time when Denmark still had a number of players in the Spain area following a long throw. 84 min Maria Leon’s free-kick is headed wide by Aleixandri, though it must have deflected off Ballisager because Spain have a corner. Leon takes it, Christensen pushes clear and Carmona’s vicious half-volley is blocked by Sara Holmgaard. The ball hit her hand, and there was a VAR check for a penalty, but the game continues. She was right on the edge of the area so it might haven been outside anyway. 82 min Nadim commits a needless foul on Maria Leon, which allows Spain to waste another 30 seconds. 80 min Sara Holmgaard immediately takes out Cardona and is a bit fortunate to avoid a yellow card. 80 min Spain bring on Laia Aleixandri for Athenea. Denmark replace Katrine Veje with Sara Holmgaard. 79 min From the resulting corner, Holmgaard loops a header back across goal and wide. 78 min: Good save from Panos! Harder runs onto a long ball forward from Holmgaard, holds off Paredes in the area and squares the ball to the supporting Nadim. She shifts it away from Maria Leon and hits a rising drive that is pushed over by the stretching Panos. It was close enough to Panos for it to be a relatively comfortable save. 77 min At the other end, Bonmati’s snapshot from 18 yards is blocked. 76 min Maria Leon loses concentration and allows the ball to run across her body. Nadim takes it off her but then tries a very ambitious chip from 40 yards. It drifts well wide. 75 min Mariona’s deep corner is headed back across goal by Paredes, but Athenea can’t control an awkward ball under pressure. 74 min Two more changes for Denmark: Nadia Nadim and Stine Larsen and replace Rikke Madsen and the excellent Janni Thomsen. It looks like they have switched to 4-3-3 as well. 72 min Harder shoots over from 25 yards after an excellent run. She was on her own against five Spain defenders, but still managed to keep the ball and eventually get her shot away. 71 min The left-back Carmona hits a good long-range drive that is pushed away by Christensen, diving low to her left. Carmona has been very enterprising in attack since she came on. 69 min Athenea wriggles away from Ballisager in the area but Boye comes across to make an excellent challenge. 67 min Athenea’s snapshot from the edge of the area is well blocked by Ballisager (I think). It feels like a Spain goal is coming. 66 min Christensen is smartly off her line to beat Esther Gonzalez to a deflected through ball. 65 min Spain have controlled the game much better in the second half, with Denmark offering little threat on the break. It might just be that they are knackered after chasing the ball for over an hour. 64 min Mariona’s left-wing corner is met ahead of the near post by Maria Leon, who tries a clever but exceedingly difficult half-volley on the turn. It hits the side netting. 63 min Free-kick to Spain on the right. Maria Leon fails to beat the first woman, an unusually poor delivery from her. 60 min Denmark have barely had a kick in the second half. But it’s still 0-0, and Spain still aren’t creating too many chances. 59 min “It’s impossible not to feel heartbroken for Putellas, such a wonderful player missing a tournament,” says Matt Dony. “ But it’s also heartbreaking for the team as a whole. It’s hard to imagine they wouldn’t have finished one of these moves if she’d been on the pitch. See also: the Germany match. I can’t stand Barcelona, but I do love watching a Spanish team tiki taka their way through a game. (I’m also drinking a Spanish red, which is as good a reason to support them as any.) Just a shame it’s not quite coming together in front of goal.” They really miss Jenni Hermoso too, even though she’s slightly past her magnificent peak. 58 min A change for Denmark: Sanne Troelsgaard replaces Kathrine Kuhl. 55 min Harder has done so much good work in wide areas. She beats Paredes again on the left, but there isn’t much support in the middle and her cross is cleared. 54 min: Chance for Spain! Cardona’s deep cross is palmed away unconvincingly by the stretching Christensen. Carmona runs onto the loose ball, eight yards out, and smashes a half-volley into the side netting. 53 min Batlle fizzes a square pass to Bonmati in the area. She turns superbly but then turns again, back into a crowd, and is eventually dispossessed. 52 min Madsen tries to chase down Panos and seems to be tripped by Carmona. The referee disagrees. 50 min Thomsen’s precise cutback finds Madsen, whose first-time shot is well blocked by Paredes. Madsen caught that sweetly and I think it was going on target. 48 min The substitute Cardona has a speculative cross shot kicked away by Sevecke in the six-yard box. The longer this stays 0-0, the more Spain will think the unthinkable. 47 min “Verticalidad is all well and good,” says Peter Oh, “but I fear that there are many young fans watching out there whose old man has had one too many beers and is in danger of becoming horizontaldad.” Honk! 46 min Peep peep! Denmark begin the second half. Spain are making three half-time changes: Esther Gonzalez, Marta Cardona and Olga Carmona replace Leila Ouahabi, Lucia Garcia and Sheila Garcia. “According to the Spanish press, Vilda claimed that replacing Laia with Athenea would give more ‘verticalidad’,” says Charles Antaki. “Not really much in evidence, more the usual horizontal horseshoe, but a Danish goal might change that.” What they really need is a velocista. Half-time reading The end of an intriguing half, and for once that’s not a euphemism. The pattern of the game - counter-attack vs tiki-taka - was exactly as expected, and both teams had decent chances. A shock could yet be on. 45+2 min Paredes heads wide from Ouahabi’s deep cross. It wasn’t an easy header, with Sevecke (I think) ensuring she couldn’t get a clear run at the ball. 45 min: Off the line by Boye! Mariona drives a deep corner towards Paredes, whose powerful header beats Christensen and is headed clear by Simone Boye. 44 min The increasingly dangerous Athenea beats Thomsen, forcing Ballisager to come across and concede a corner. 43 min Kuhl beats Batlle three times in about five seconds before finding the overlapping Veje. Her cross is too close to Panos. 41 min Athenea’s wobbling long-range shot is comfortably held by Christensen. 38 min This is Spain’s best spell of the game, and Boye has to make an important lunging tackle on Athenea in the area. 36 min A big let off for Christensen! She dropped a deep cross at the feet of Athenea, whose close-range shot was blocked by Thomsen. In Christensen’s defence, she reacted quickly to her error and might have saved Athenea’s shot herself; Thomsen made sure that wasn’t necessary. 35 min Patri drags well wide from long range. 33 min: Good save from Christensen! That was better from Spain. They kept the ball for an age until Paredes (I think) fed a lovely pass into Batlle in the area. She squared it to Mariona, whose low shot was well saved to her left by Christensen. Mariona didn’t connect with the shot as well as she would have liked. 32 min Before the game I suspect Denmark would have been happy to keep it 0-0 for as long as possible, and let the pressure build on Spain. But they’ve had so many decent openings on the break that they are probably frustrated not to be ahead. 30 min Ouahabi is booked for dissent. She isn’t on a yellow card so will still be available for the quarter-final if Spain get there, unless she’s sent off. 29 min “Hey Rob, I’m also in the Canadian televisual desert,” says Billy Ditchburn. “We are blindly dependent on the quality of your commentary! No pressure! Enjoy!” MBM pressure is a privilege, or something. 28 min Another chance on the break for Denmark! Harder charges into space down the left, gets to the byline and lays the ball back to the onrushing Holmgaard (I think). She can’t control it on the stretch and the danger passes. Harder has been brilliant so far. 26 min Athenea tries a roulette just inside the Denmark penalty area and is well challenged by Ballisager. 25 min: Chance for Spain! They’ve worked Christensen now! After a patient passing move, Batlle whips a brilliant cross that hits both Ballisager and Athenea and ends up in the hands of Christensen. At first it looked like a bad miss, but it was actually brilliant defending from Ballisager, who stooped in front of Athenea to get the first contact on the ball. Had Athenea got there first she would surely have scored. 24 min This is a really intriguing game. Spain continue to dominate possession, of course they do, but they haven’t really worked Lene Christensen. 21 min Mariona loops a header over the bar from 12 yards. A decent effort. 20 min It was a really risky tackle from Athenea. I think it probably was a foul - she got the ball but it looked like she went through Thomsen to get it - but you couldn’t call it a clear and obvious error. The ball then ran to Kuhl, who had a close-range shot blocked. Denmark have certainly had the better chances. 20 min Athenea came on the wrong side of Thomsen, who was about to shoot following a low cross from the left. We haven’t seen a replay, but it doesn’t look like VAR is going to get involved. 19 min Denmark have a penalty appeal turned down when Athenea makes a clumsy tackle on Thomsen. I’d like to see that again. 19 min The first ten minutes looked a bit ominous for Denmark, but Lars Sondergaard will be really pleased with how it has gone since then. Denmark look really dangerous on the counter-attack. 17 min “After the disappointment against Germany,” says Peter Oh, “I suspect that today the pain of Spain stays mainly with the Danes.” What is this, 1984, and 1986, and 1988, and 1993, and men’s football? 16 min Harder looks bang up for this. She gallops onto a return ball from Madsen, on the right-hand side of the area, and hammers a shot from a tight angle that is held at the second attempt by Panos. 14 min: Another chance for Denmark! Harder runs onto a long, angled pass, beats the outrushing Panos to the ball and lobs over from 20 yards. Panos caught her after the ball had gone, and Denmark wanted a foul, but Rebecca Welch wasn’t interested. That was a decent chance for Harder, though she had to take it early and with Panos flying towards her. 12 min: Chance for Denmark! Harder picks up a loose ball in the centre circle and surges away from Maria Leon. She angles a pass to Karen Holmgaard, who miscontrols it on the edge of the area. A better first touch would have set her up for a shot. 11 min It’s a sultry night in west London, not the ideal conditions in which to be chasing the ball for 90 minutes. At this stage, Denmark are struggling to do much more than that. 10 min Possession percentage so far: Denmark 29-71 Spain. 9 min “I am out here and looking forward to the match, none of us in Canada has a broadcaster for this competition!” says Rupert Downing. “So we rely on your text commentary, which is great but not live TV :) I fancy Spain on this one.” With the qualifier that I know the square root of bugger all about Canadian TV, I’m slightly surprised to hear that. 7 min Ouahabi’s cross from the left just evades Bonmati in the middle. Moments later, Maria Leon’s excellent cross is headed behind well by Sevecke, with Lucia Garcia waiting behind her. 5 min Spain have settled quickly into their pass-and-move groove. Denmark’s shape is more 5-4-1 than 3-4-3 at this stage, though they are springing quickly on the counter-attack. 3 min Bonmati picks the pocket of Junge in the centre circle, makes 30 yards and finds Athenea on the left edge of the area. She tries to cut inside and is dispossessed. 1 min A dangerous ball from Mariona on the left flashes across the face of the Denmark goal. 1 min Peep peep! Denmark v Spain is under way. There’s a kit clash, so Spain are wearing their pale blue change strip. The Danish coach Lars Sondergaard speaks We know it’s going to be very difficult. We will have to defend more than we are used to, but we believe that we can surprise them. [To go through] would be exceptional. It would be a dream come true to beat one of the best teams in Europe. If we do it, with the self-confidence we would gain, and I don’t know what would stop us. As we’ve said two or three gazillion times, one of these teams will play England in the quarter-final on Wednesday. Here are a couple of freshly baked features on a team who have got the country singing Sweet Caroline. The ladies: not for turning There was some criticism of Spain’s approach after their 2-0 defeat to Germany, when they had around 70 per cent of the possession but only a couple of shots on target. Anyone who has followed Spanish football over the past 15 years won’t be surprised to hear that they will be sticking to plan A, now and probably forever. Finland v Germany is the other game tonight. You can follow that one with Will Unwin. There are four changes for Denmark from the 1-0 win over Finland, with Nadia Nadim and Signe Bruun among those left out. Simone Boye Sorensen, Karen Holmgaard, Rikke Marie Madsen and the brilliant teenager Kathrine Kuhl come in for Sara Thrige, Sanne Troelsgaard, Nadim and Bruun. Just the one change for Spain – Athenea del Castillo replaces Laia Aleixandri. That will mean a slight rejig, with Mariona Caldentey probably dropping into midfield. Denmark (possible 3-4-3) Christensen; Ballisager, Boye, Sevecke; Thomsen, K Holmgaard, Junge, Veje; Madsen, Harder, Kuhl. Substitutes: Svane, Nielsen, Thrige, S Troelsgaard, S Holmgaard, Nadim, Larsen, Bredgaard, Gevitz, Bruun, Gejl, Svava. Spain (possible 4-1-2-3) Panos; Batlle, Paredes, Leon, Ouahabi; Bonmati, Patri, Mariona; S Garcia, L Garcia, Athenea. Substitutes: Gallardo, Rodriguez, Aleixandri, Andres, Guerrero, Gonzalez, Cardona, Sarriegi, Abelleira, Carmona, Pereira, Pina. Referee Rebecca Welch (Britain) The knockout phase of Euro 2022 officially begins on Wednesday. In reality, it’s well under way. Austria beat Norway in a Group A eliminator last night, and now Spain play Denmark for the right to meet England in the quarter-finals. Both teams have beaten Finland and lost to Germany, but Spain’s goal difference is superior so they only need a draw tonight. That makes them very strong favourites to go through. While they are clearly missing the injured Alexia Putellas and Jenni Hermoso, they remain a formidable side who keep the ball better than anyone in the tournament. Spain can be shot-shy at the best of times; tonight, at least while it remains 0-0, they can tiki-taka to their heart’s content. Denmark, runners up in 2017, have struggled in what is a fiendishly difficult group. They were hammered by Germany and needed a brilliant late save from Lene Christensen to beat Finland in Milton Keynes on Tuesday. But they have a proud record in this competition – one final, five semi-finals – so I’d be loath to write them off. This would be a very good night for Pernille Harder to remind the world of her greatness. Kick off 8pm."
article8,Pernille Harder breaks deadlock for Denmark to edge past Finland,2022-07-12 18:29:14,"[""Women's Euro 2022"", ""Denmark women's football team"", ""Finland women's football team"", ""Women's football"", 'Football', 'Sport']","On a sultry evening in Milton Keynes, Finland’s hopes to progress past the group stages of the Women’s European Championship were quashed by Denmark who struck in the 72nd minute via a close-range header from Chelsea’s Pernille Harder. The result means that theoretically Lars Søndergaard’s Danes can still make it to the quarter-finals although they will probably need to avoid defeat against Spain in their final group game on Saturday. Both teams began the game with attacking intent, buoyed by the charged atmosphere created by a crowd of 11,615. Denmark channelled that energy into an empowered offensive performance, in stark comparison to their opening game of the tournament, Friday’s passive 4-0 loss to Germany. That defeat featured a defensive trio of Rikke Sevecke, Stine Pedersen, and Katrine Veje. Despite their unfavourable contributions on Friday, all three were trusted to start again here. It proved to be a wise tactical decision on Søndergaard’s part; Sevecke and her fellow defenders were able to successfully manage Finland’s forays forward, breaking up possession and recycling quickly to transition into counterattacks. Harder led the charge, probing stealthily on the left flank, as well as trying her hand from more central positions. The defensive strategy was to combat her tricks by cutting off any and all spaces for the forward to drive into. Yet, where Harder may have been occupied, both Signe Bruun and Nadia Nadim took matters into their own hands, and it was through the pair that Denmark had their first shot on target after nine minutes. As the game progressed, it became increasingly clear that any of Denmark’s attacking triumvirate could open the scoring. Were it not for another hatful of saves from Finland’s Tinja-Riika Korpela – the keeper who amassed the most number of saves in the opening fixture of the Euros (nine) – then it might have happened a lot sooner than it did. Indeed, it took until 18 minutes from time, several changes from both teams, and persistent pressure directed toward Finland’s defence for Denmark to get the goal they desperately needed in a must-win game. A looping cross found substitute Karen Holmgaard in the box. Her header clattered off the crossbar and Harder swooped in to head home her 69th goal in 136 appearances. For all of Denmark’s dominance with possession and clear-cut chances, it had taken bit of luck in the latter stages of the game to break Finland’s regimented back four. It so nearly wasn’t enough. In injury time Jenny Danielsson twisted clear and her shot was rising towards the top corner only for Lene Christensen to produce a superb save to tip it over the crossbar. Moments before, Harder had been substituted after a collision with Emma Kolvisto, and left the field holding an ice pack to her head. She returned to celebrate victory with her teammates, and collect the player of the match award."
article9,Germany 4-0 Denmark: Women’s Euro 2022 – as it happened,2022-07-08 21:07:56,"[""Women's Euro 2022"", ""Germany women's football team"", ""Denmark women's football team"", 'Football', 'Sport']","I’m closing this blog down now but here’s the report from our reporter at Brentford. Thanks for reading. Bye! Never underestimate the Germans. Their coach, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, had wondered whether they might catch a few opponents off guard this summer after a couple of modest showings at major tournaments, as wild a notion as that might seem given they have won the European Championship eight times. On this evidence, who could possibly believe they will not win a ninth? Lina Magull has been handed the official Player of the Match award. I can’t argue with that, she was brilliant, but so were many of her teammates, Huth, Obendorf and Schuller particularly. Germany looked for all the world like the eight-time European champions that they are. The Danish fans look crestfallen. They had great expectations of their team but they were torn apart. They could barely string two passes together under intense pressure from Germany and Harder cut a frustrated figure up front. I’m not sure playing three at the back against three inventive forwards like Germany’s was a good tactic to stick with. Huth, Oberdorf and Magull were outstanding for Germany. Their subs weren’t half bad either. What a performance by Germany. If people didn’t know what to expect from them before the Euros, they certainly do now. They were incredible, pressing Denmark into submission and embarrassing them. 90+4 min: Kuhl is sent off for a second bookable offence. What a sorry night for Denmark. 90+4 min: Hegereing is booked for dragging down Harder. 90+3 min: Huth curls it into the near post … and Denmark clear at the second attempt. 90+1 min: Germany attack with flair and panache, like they have done for most of the game. Larsen is booked for hauling down Dallmann. 90 min: There will be four more minutes of this torture for Denmark. 88 min: The Germany fans are in full voice – and well they might be. This is a performance that marks their team out as proper contenders. Fancy playing these? Nope. Now this is a rout. And what a goal. Brand finds Lohmann on the overlap and Popp dives in to head home her cross for her 54th goal for her nation. What a moment. The veteran looks overawed. 82 min: Some changes: Thomsen is replaced by Larsen for Denmark. And Germany switch out their brilliant engine, Oberdorf, with Lohmann. Vorsprung durch technik. 81 min: I didn’t expect this. Germany have been incessant in their intensity. They seem to have so many ways to attack, too. They can go long, short or play on the counter. Denmark have not known how to handle them and Spain v Germany is looking really tasty. Game over. Oberdorf is first to a high free-kick and simply pops a header down to Lattwein, who takes touch to get the ball out of her feet before crashing a low drive in at the near post. Germany really are looking like the team to beat, Kari. 77 min: “Denmark are no fools, and they’ve tried all kinds of ways to deal with the German press,” writes Kári Tulinius. “But when they play out from the back they lose the ball in their final third, when they go long the Germans come back at their goal at full pelt, and when they try to keep possession they get swarmed by white shirts. With the caveat that eight sides are yet to play, Germany is looking like the team to beat.” 75 min: A chance for Denmark. Nadim heads over after a dangerous inswinger from Thomsen. 74 min: Germany think they have scored … but the offside flag goes up. Brand, who has just come on for Bühl, is sent scampering through. She cuts inside and goes down but the ball falls loose to Hüth, who sidefoots home. A quick VAR check shows that Brand was a half-yard offside as she broke through. As you were. 72 min: Rauch is booked for a cynical foul on Thomsen, who was looking to make a late break up the Denmark right. 70 min: And that is Magull’s last contribution. The Bayern Munich playmaker has been outstanding tonight. It’s a a toss-up between her and Huth for player of the match in my opinion. She is replaced by Bayern teammate Dallmann. Magull looks a bit peeved about that. And Denmark bring on Sorensen for Svava. 67 min: Hegering, a centre-back, dinks a beautiful 35 yard-pass to Magull, who takes the ball down brilliantly and strikes at goal only to see it deflected out for a corner. Magull’s corner is dealt with scrappily and half cleared back out to the left, where Magull slides in and wins back possession. Germany come again. 65 min: Harder uses her nous to win a corner when she clearly had no support. It’s a fine delivery from Thomsen that Sevecke heads over when she perhaps could have got over it more. She holds her head ruefully as she jogs away. A rare chance to get back in the match spurned. 63 min: The Danish changes have made no difference to the flow of Germany attacking play. The Danes are being gegenpressed to death. 60 min: Now Germany make a triple substitution: Lattwein, Popp and Brand replace Dabritz, Schuller and Bruhl. Lattwein’s first touch is to glance a corner on to the near post. That’s the fourth time Germany have hit the woodwork. 59 min: A moment before that goal, Denmark made a triple substitution. Madsen, Troelsgaard and Bruun were taken off and Gejl, Kuhl and Nadim (an Afghan refugee who is an incredible person) were brought on. Such upheaval before defending a corner was probably not helpful to defensive organisation. … from which Magull curls an inswinger into the six yard box that Schüller leaps up to head home. She got in front of Christensen, who was left flapping at the ball. They deserve their two-goal lead. They’ve been far the better side. Can Denmark respond? 55 min: Magull rifles an effort at goal from 20 yards that Christensen pushes round the post. Corner … 54 min: A decent spell for Denmark. Perhaps some players are trying to avoid getting the hook. Madsen lets fly from distance but it’s well wide. 52 min: Oberdorf shows a lovely little bit of skill to zip into the box and find Huth, who shoots at goal only to see it blocked. The ball breaks to Dabritz. She tries to turn and shoot but she sees only Danish defenders. She showboats with a dazzling little flick in the area and then works the ball wide to Bühl, who is tackled. This is all too easy for Germany and Sondegaard is lining up a number of Denmark changes. 51 min: Madsen does well to hold up the ball and works it back to Sevecke, who undoes all her good work by sidefooting the ball forwards to nobody. Madsen jumps in frustration. 49 min: Hegering pings a long diagonal ball out towards Veje strains her neck to head clear. Germany pick up possession and begin their next dominant spell of possession. 47 min: Germany have started the second half as they ended the first: in control. 45 min: Peep! False start. Peep again! Now the second half begins. There don’t appear to have been any changes. And Denmark look to be sticking with three at the back. There is almost an immediate mix-up in the Danish defence. Then Germany attack down the left but Sevecke cuts out the cross and Christensen smothers the ball. The good news for Denmark fans is that their team only trails by a goal and probably can’t play much worse. A tactical tweak to deal with the treat of Huth would certainly help and then they need to consider how to get the ball into Harder and support her. We’ll know shortly if Sondegaard has made any changes. Germany will surely stay as they are. Their tactics and team chemistry have been spot on. Half-time reading A simple ball over the top finds Schüller, who clatters a shot at Christensen. She parries to Magull, who heads wide. And that’s that. Germany could be two or three goals to the good. A brilliant half by them and a very poor one from Denmark, who have much work to do. 45 min: There will be one minute of added time for Germany to improve their possession stats. 43 min: Germany are knocking the ball around for fun here, finding pockets of space and looking like they have 12 players. Lars Sondegaard may want to consider ditching his three-player central defence and matching Germany up. At the moment it’s three on three when Germany attack. 41 min: Harder receives the ball with her back to goal. Hendrich is all over her, though, and the Denamrk captain is forced backwards. She needs some runners off her. She’s clever enough to find them. 39 min: Oberdorf is booked for a lunge on Pedersen. The youngster loves a tackle and will have to watch herself now. 38 min: Germany change tack and go long. Schüller’s flick on finds Bühl, who flashes a wicked right-footed drive over the bar. 37 min: Magull and Huth have been a class apart so far fro Germany. Harder has shown some nice touches for Denmark but has looked isolated when in possession. 35 min: Magull plays a lovely give and go in midfield before accelerating towards goal and crashing a low drive straight at Christensen. It came after Denmark ran out of ideas when trying to play out from the back and gave the ball away under pressure for the umpteenth time this evening. 34 min: A speculative effort from Thomsen on the right, who drops her shoulder and curls a left-footed shot towards the near post that Frohms collects comfortably. 32 min: Germany’s press ruffles a few Danish feathers again. Huth, inevitably, is involved on the right and she plays in Gwinn on the overlap but a solid tackle from Svava halts the attack. 31 min: And now Denmark win a corner after an adventurous run up the left from Svava who has had a torrid time on the left so far. Thomsen’s low corner is missed by everyone and bobbles through the area before Germany clear. 29 min: A chance for Denmark. Bruuns takes a high ball on her chest and perfectly sets herself up for a ferocious shot on the bounce from 18 yards out that Frohms has to leap to palm away. That came out of nothing but is a warning for Germany. 27 min: So if the question was: which Germany will turn up? The answer, so far, is a very good one, full of energy and invention. 25 min: Harder gives away a foul as she tracks back and trips an opponent in frustration. Denmark need to have a think about how to deal with the Germany threat on the right. Huth plays in Schüller with a delightful through ball after some good build up play. She cuts the ball back into the six yard box where a panicked St Pedersen hoofs out for a corner. The corner is cleared but back Germany come. 22 min: The Danes haven’t been able to cope with Germany’s intensity. They’ve also been so sloppy in possession. This had been coming. Bruun plays a woeful ball back towards St Pedersen, who loses out in a tackle with Magull on the edge of her box. The midfielder races into the box and absolutely smashes the ball past Christensen from 10 yards. The Denmark keeper had no chance. A deserved lead. 18 min: Huth shows Veje a clean pair of heels again and whips a vicious cross in to the six-yard box. It’s ever so slightly behind Magull, who contorts her body to try and get a volley on goal, but the ball rather bounces off her thigh and into the arms of the diving Christensen, who is Denmark’s busiest player by some distance. 17 min: I’m not sure wing-backs is working for Denmark here. Huth is getting acres of space on the right, as she sits in the pocket between Svava and Veje. It would also help if Denmark could keep hold of possession but they can’t. They’re treating the ball like a hot potato. 15 min: A Germany corner is held brilliantly by Christensen, who leaps above a crowd of at least eight players to claim. 12 min: … only for Bühl to retrieve it and lay the ball off to Rauch, WHO HITS THE BAR AGAIN! This time the left-back smashes the shot at goal from 25 yards out. It takes a slight deflection on its way through I think. The rebound is headed against the post by Schüller, but she was offside. Germany are well on top. 11 min: Germany passing the ball around very nicely here and Denmark are unsure when to press. Huth gets her dancing feet going on the right and whips a delicious ball in that Denmark hook clear … 9 min: Rauch smashes the ball against the bar! The ball is cut back to the edge of the box, where the Germany left-back is lurking. Her eyes light up as she crashes a shot at the top corner that cannons against the corner of post and upright. The ball arrives at the feet of Dabritz, who drags wide. She was offside anyway. Germany are on top here. 7 min: Thomsen is clattered by Bühl, who looks well up for this. The Dane is soon back up on her feet and tormenting Gwinn over on the right. She sits the Germany full-back down with a sharp turn inside and then picks out Madsen, who glances a difficult headed chance wide. 6 min: After a nervy start, Germany are suddenly looking confident on the ball. Huth chases down a long diagonal and picks the pocket of Veje, who had got to the ball first. She races to the byline and pulls a cross back to Bühl, who does well to direct a header just over the bar. She had to really twist her neck to get to that. 4 min: Huth zips up the right wing and lofts a cross into the near post but Denmark goalkeeper Christensen is out on it like a flash and gathers comfortably. 2 min: It’s a sharp start from the Danes. Harder shows her skills early on with a swift turn before slipping in Madsen on the edge of the box. She tries to pop the ball in behind the Germany defence to Bruun, but Hegering is alert to the danger and steps in to pick up possession. 1 min: We’re under way in Brentford. Denmark, in red, are shooting from right to left on my telly. Germany, in white, are going the other way. There’s a decent crowd at Brentford but I’m betting that it’s below that of the earlier Group B game. The Denmark anthem is belted out by players and fans alike. Denmark has two anthems and this one is the civil one I believe: “There is a lovely land”. Then Germany, who have only one, give a rousing rendition of “Das Deutschlandlied”. I’d argue that was louder in the stands, too, so perhaps Germany have the better support. Time for kick off! It’s not long until kick-off now. The two teams are led out by their captains. Germany skipper Svenja Huth has her poker face on as she takes her side out. And Pernille Harder looks cool and collected as she strides out with her Denmark side in tow. Both captains are clever forwards with bags of experience and bundles of silverware. The game may well be decided by one of them. Germany were knocked out by Denmark in the 2017 quarter-finals, so revenge may well be in the air in west London. Here’s how that one went down five years ago: A bit of breaking news from the England camp. I really hope Covid doesn’t sink its teeth into this tournament. “Do you know what beers are being served at the concession stands,” asks Peter Oh. “If Carlsberg is available but not Paulaner, the Danes will undoubtedly enjoy a massive psychological advantage!” Given the Fuller’s brewery is just round the corner, I’m guessing they’re keeping it neutral. Another Women’s European Championship record was broken earlier, with Spain v Finland attracting 16,819 fans, the highest-ever attendance for a group-stage game not involving a host. Can Germany v Denmark break that? Brentford’s capacity is over 17,000, so it is big enough to see that record fall very quickly. Spain lay down a Group B marker with their 4-1 defeat of Finland. Here’s what our Spanish football correspondent Sid Lowe, in Milton Keynes (we don’t get to write that much), made of the match: The Finland coach Anna Signeul had warned that Spain have a lot of Alexia Putellas on their team, which might have been pushing it a bit, but they can certainly play, that’s for sure. Cruelly denied the chance to grace this stage by a torn cruciate ligament suffered just 48 hours before it all began, the world’s best footballer sat in the stands, crutches at her side, and watched her team mates give a demonstration of their art with a 4-1 victory over Siegneul’s side in Milton Keynes. Germany: Frohms, Gwinn, Hendrich, Hegering, Rauch, Oberdorf, Dabritz, Magull, Huth, Schuller, Buhl. Subs: Schult, Kleinherne, Lattwein, Lohmann, Freigang, Popp, Anyomi, Dallmann, Wasmuth, Brand, Doorsoun, Berger. Denmark: Christensen, Sevecke, Ballisager, Veje, Thomsen, Troelsgaaard Nielsen, Junge Pedersen, Svava, Madsen, Bruun, Mosegaard-Harder. Subs: Svane, Thrige, Boye Sorensen, Karen Holmgaard, Sara Holmgaard, Nadim, Larsen, Bredgaard, Kuhl, Gevitz, Gejl, Worsoe. Referee: Esther Staubli (Switzerland) I’m not sure which team will pull in the biggest following at Brentford this evening but Germany manager Martina Voss-Tecklenburg will be hoping it’s them. She believes that some of her less experienced players struggled with the atmosphere in the 3-1 defeat by England at Molineux in February. Here’s what she had to say: It is actually quite difficult to prepare the players for it. We saw that at the preparation tournament, the Arnold Clark Cup, when there were suddenly thousands of fans in the stadium against England and they made a huge noise - that did something to some of our younger players. There was no longer the same belief, the same certainty there. But the only way is to gain that experience. And as if by magic, here’s your photo of Thomas Frank with Denmark fans at Brentford. Now I’d like to see Christian Eriksen and Jan Molby. Oh, and the Laudrup brothers, Sofie Gråbøl from The Killing and Brigitte Nielsen, too. Or maybe that’s asking too much? It’s still a baking hot 27c in London so conditions will be sticky when the match kicks off. The players are already at the futuristic-looking Brentford Community Stadium, where Karen Holmgaard and Pernille Harder have led the Denmark players out to inspect the pitch. There couldn’t be a better place for the Danes to play, given Brentford’s links with their home nation. Perhaps Bees boss Thomas Frank will be in attendance to cheer on his nation tonight. He likes leading a singalong so he’ll be perfect for getting the atmosphere going. In the other Group B match, tournament favourites Spain have swept Finland aside. After going 1-0 behind early on, they roared back and a Caldentey penalty in injury time gave the scoreline a little gloss. Sarah Rendell was watching that one. You can join her for reaction here before checking back in with me. Good evening. What a match we have in store for you tonight! The Pernille Harder-powered Danes were runners-up in 2017 and are one of the favourites to win Euro 2022. They are likely to be one of the tournament’s most free-flowing sides with experienced manager Lars Søndergaard preferring a 3-4-3 formation with wing-backs. And if you think this means they might be a bit open at the back, qualifying suggests you’d be wrong. The Danes scored 48 goals and conceded only once to win their group. They beat Austria and Brazil in warm-up games though they did lose 2-1 to Norway, another fancied team in this tournament who got off to a flying start with a 4-1 defeat of Northern Ireland last night. As for Germany, they have incredible pedigree in this tournament, winning it a record eight times but they are a bit of a mixed bag at the moment and predicting how they will perform is difficult. They have not progressed past the quarter-finals in their last two major tournaments, the 2019 World Cup and 2017 Euros, but manager Martina Voss-Tecklenburg believes this can “lead to a few teams underestimating us”. Will Denmark do that at the Brentford Community Stadium? We will soon see. I’m looking forward to seeing 20-year-old Germany dynamo Lena Oberdorf. The Wolfsburg midfielder is still so young yet plays with the commanding authority of a wily old pro. My prediction: Denmark 2-1 Germany"
article10,Denmark votes overwhelmingly to join EU’s common defence policy,2022-06-01 22:14:02,"['Denmark', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Nato', 'Ukraine', 'Russia']","Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to reshape Europe’s security landscape. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month. Denmark, historically critical of the EU, secured exemptions from joining the common security and defence policy (CSDP) and the euro in a 1993 referendum, but the country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was time to change tack. “Tonight Denmark has sent a very important signal. To our allies in Europe and Nato, and to Putin,” she told cheering supporters on Wednesday evening after the result was published. “We’re showing that when Putin invades a free country and threatens stability in Europe, we others pull together. “Denmark now can partake in the European cooperation on defence and security. And for that I’m very, very happy.” Frederiksen called the referendum barely two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after reaching an agreement with a majority of parties in the Danish parliament, and pledged to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033. “Nato will of course remain our most important tool, but the EU gives us another in securing our defence in the east,” the ruling Social Democrats’ defence spokesperson, Mogens Jensen, said. Eleven of Denmark’s 14 parties, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament, had urged voters to drop the opt-out. “The world is changing, and not in a good way. We need to stand together and strengthen the cooperation that strengthens our security,” said Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, head of the opposition Liberal party. Participation in the EU’s defence policy will allow Denmark, a founding Nato member, to take part in joint EU military operations, such as those in Bosnia, Mali and Somalia, and will allow Danish officials to stay in the room when EU colleagues discuss defence issues. EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel welcomed the result. Denmark’s decision was a “strong message of commitment to our common security”, Von der Leyen tweeted, saying Denmark and the European Union would benefit. “This decision will benefit Europe and make both the EU and the Danish people safer and stronger,” Michel wrote on Twitter. It would be seen largely as a symbolic win in Brussels, experts said. “The political significance will outweigh the military contribution,” said Kristian Soby Kristensen, a senior researcher at Copenhagen University’s Centre for Military Studies. Those opposed to abandoning the opt-out argued that the EU’s defence cooperation is hampered by excessive bureaucracy and inefficient decision-making, and that a joint European defence would come at the expense of Nato."
article11,Magull and Schüller lead Germany to emphatic opening win over Denmark,2022-07-08 21:05:16,"[""Women's Euro 2022"", ""Germany women's football team"", ""Denmark women's football team"", 'Football', 'Sport']","This was some way to set a marker. Germany’s coach, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, had wondered whether they might catch opponents off guard this summer after a couple of modest showings at major tournaments, as wild a notion as that might seem given they have already won eight European Championships. Their rivals can now consider themselves duly warned: this was an urgent, insistent, top-quality performance that demolished a fancied Denmark side and merited an even higher margin of victory. Given the calibre of their display and the opposition it overwhelmed, Germany must surely be regarded as the early favourites. Even though two of their goals, through the substitutes Lena Lattwein and Alexandra Popp, arrived in the closing stages this was no artificial scoreline. From the opening whistle Germany had torn the Danes apart down the flanks and it was a minor miracle that they had only scored once by half-time. They were more clinical thereafter and what a tormenting night this was for Denmark, who rarely managed to involve Pernille Harder in a spluttering attack and threatened sporadically at best. Kathrine Møller Kühl’s dismissal in added time made matters even worse. “We played an outstanding game,” Voss-Tecklenburg said. “We were incredibly dominant and aggressive, it was a great team effort from everyone involved.” At the outset this occasion had held a celebratory air for Denmark, who were boisterously supported at what has become an enclave of their country in west London. The Brentford men’s club has a heavy Danish influence and its manager, Thomas Frank, could be seen mingling among his compatriots before the game. Anyone considering that an advantage was disabused of the idea, though, as Germany raced out of the blocks. The right winger Svenja Huth had Katrine Veje, the woefully exposed left centre-back in Denmark’s back three, on toast and created a chance for Klara Bühl within five minutes. It was the marauding left-back Felicitas Rauch, though, who rang the loudest alarm bells. Remarkably she hit the bar twice in the first 13 minutes, clattering the frame from 20 yards after Sara Däbritz had kept her feet smartly before repeating the trick at a slightly further distance when fed by Bühl. Then Lina Magull forced a flying save from Lene Christensen with an improvised effort from Huth’s cross and the opener came to appear a matter of time. It arrived in the 21st minute after Denmark had overcomplicated a move out from the back. Signe Bruun, their striker, had dropped deep into her own half and sold Stine Pedersen short with a backwards pass. Pedersen had few options but to try and clear, with Magull arriving at speed; the Germany forward charged her attempt down and was able to run through, belting an unstoppable finish past Christensen from a slight angle on the right. The Bayern Munich schemer Magull, playing in the No 10 position, was outstanding in her 69 minutes on the pitch and deserved to be named player of the match. Behind her the midfield pivot of Däbritz and Lena Oberdorf allowed little through, the only significant exception being a turn and shot by Bruun that Merle Frohms parried acrobatically just before the half-hour. “We were at it right away and created plenty of scoring chances that we didn’t really take advantage of in the first half,” noted Voss-Tecklenburg, but Germany soon put that right. It was galling for Denmark that their coach, Lars Søndergaard, had just made a triple substitution when the lead was doubled 11 minutes after the interval. Nadia Nadim was among those introduced but had not touched the ball when the generally reliable Christensen made a sprawling low save from Magull. From the resulting corner, the keeper blotted her copybook badly. Magull’s floated set-piece from the left was well delivered but not especially menacing; Christensen came out to collect but became mired in a crowd of bodies and the forward Lea Schüller, another excellent performer from Bayern Munich, could nod into a vacant goal with the keeper stranded. “We didn’t play with courage,” Søndergaard admitted. His players attacked in vain towards a gorgeous pink sunset as the minutes ticked down but their prospects soon turned pitch black. Lattwein, found unmarked by Oberdorf’s towering header, lashed inside the near post and then Popp completed the rout emphatically from a Sydney Lohmann delivery. Popp has only just returned from a year-long injury layoff; events have shifted in her favour and perhaps that goes for Germany too. “We played ourselves into a frenzy,” said Schüller, not inaccurately, of an exceptional night’s work. Their fellow contenders might just work themselves into one as they seek ways to stop them."
article12,Denmark 1-0 Finland: Women’s Euro 2022 Group B – as it happened,2022-07-12 18:17:48,"[""Women's Euro 2022"", 'Sport', 'Football', ""Denmark women's football team"", ""Finland women's football team""]","And here’s our match report; now it really is goodbye. Goodbye! Otherwise, though, it’s ta-ra from me. Peace out. Righto, that’s us for now. Except it isn’t really, because all you actually need to do is click here to find Germany v Spain, along with Rob Smyth, there to glory your evening. As for Denmark, they’ll have to play a lot better than that to get something against Spain. Where there’s Harder there’s hope, but based on what we’ve seen so far, that looks a forlorn one. Finland, you’ve to assume, will wonder if they might’ve done more. They had nothing going forward and even after Denmark looked blunt in the first half, rather than seek a win, they stuck another player in defence and still conceded chances. Christensen lets it all out at the whistle and it’s she to whom her mates run, not their goalscoring captain. that tells you all you need to know, and Denmark are still in the competition, while Finland are almost home. 90+4 min ...and Christensen comes to gather! She has saved her team! 90+3 min Lene Christensen! Ninety-three minutes of staring, then Danielsson skips away from Holmgaard, who wails in fear, unleashes a banger of a shot ... and Christensen tips it behind! That’s a brilliant save, but her comes the corner... 90+1 min And if Finland are still losing at the end of them, a draw in the Germany v Spain game which comes next will put them out. 90 min There’ll be four added minutes. 90 min Last try for Finland: Westerlund is replaced by Danielsson. 88 min So far, Denmark have seen this out well – though Finland haven’t tested them much, even to the extent of smashing it mixer. 86 min Boye replaces Harder, now sat at the side with a hunk of ice on her phizog. 85 min Eeesh! Harder is bodied by Kolvisto competing for a header, and after receiving treatment on the park, she’s escorted off looking woozy. 84 min Finland win a free-kick just left of centre and Franssi floats a decent delivery into the box ... and Kuikka, in the middle of a phalanx of defenders, is up! She gets the touch too, but it’s no more than a flick and sails behind. 82 min Finland have barely had the ball since conceding but they move forward now with Ahtinen, who slices a shot wide and plenty. 80 min Nice from Larsen, who battles down the right and finds the recently-impressive Johnsen, who curves in a low cross first-time ... but Westerlund gets it away. 78 min Finland send on Ahtinen for Sallstrom. 76 min Sevecke slides in on Summanen, feathers the top of the ball almost inadvertently then ploughs through her opponent ... and somehow evades a second yellow card. I don’t especially object to challenges like that being punished with a free-kick and nothing more, but I don’t see how the laws allow such thing. 75 min In the Germany game, Harder didn’t manage a touch in the opposition box. Against admittedly lesser opposition, she’s been much better today, and I’d expect her to sustain that improvement for the Spain game because she’s too good not to. However, her teammates will have to do more to find her. 74 min With the deadlock now broken, I’d not be surprised to see Denmark add another goal or two. One hundred and sixty-two minutes and out! Harder wins the ball high up the pitch as Finland see to bring it cleat and another decent cross from right-wing to back post, Johnsen with it again, sees Larsen up! But Holmgaard finds redemption by leaping all over her, banging a header onto the bar with enough force so that it bounces out in the middle and straight to Harder ... who adjusts well by retreating quickly, sorting out her feet to nod home from three yards. 71 min Denmark have improved in the last few minutes – perhaps the changes are working, perhaps Finland are tiring, perhaps both – but I’m a little surprised they’ve retained the formation that is now 161 minutes without a goal. 69 min Korpela! Harder controls beautifully and beats two players, one for skill by dipping inside, and one for pace by screeching away. Then, having moved from left to centre, she releases a glorious pass into the stride of Holmgaard! She’s in! But she hangs onto the ball for too long her final touch is too heavy, and the Spurs keeper times her advance perfectly yet again, smothering the shot at source! 66 min Sevecke loses possession to Oling, tugs her back for a while, and is eventually booked. 65 min Johnsen speeds down the right and stands up a superb cross to the far post, where Kolvisto does really well to get up above Svava. 64 min Two more changes for Denmark, Holmgaard K and Larsen replacing Bruun and Troelsgaard. 62 min Decent from Denmark, Svava finding Harder who picks across the face of the box before finding Troelsgaard, on the right of the box. It’s a decent shooting opportunity ... that she slices so badly it finds Svava again! She nips inside Kolvisto, sending her off towards M&amp;S, sets back for Junge who shapes to curl into the far corner ... and tickles a shank that floats wide. 60 min Oling zones forward with the ball, has a look, has a shot, and Christensen saves easily enough. 59 min “It’s tempting to attribute those misplaced final balls to nerves,” posits Charles Antaki, “after all only three points would be any use in maintaining what is anyway a pretty slim chance of either of these two progressing from the group. So any chance must feel like a final chance, and any attempt must feel like the only attempt. End of saloon-bar pontification.” That is possible, though I wonder if they’re able to think about that in the moment. My guess is that over-eagerness is also involves, though in its way that’s the other side of the same coin. 58 min Svava is into the action immediately, nashing down the left and crossing with Hrder loitering, but Westerlund is there first. 56 min A double change for Denmark: off go Nadim, who must be knackered, with Bredgard coming on, along with Thrige, who must be naused, with Svava coming on. 54 min Ballisager challenges Kolvisto on inside the box and Kolvisto collapses. There’s a penalty appeal, but nothing doing and rightly so. 53 min Thrige, Denmarks’ most dangerous player when on the right but now on the left, tries a cross that hits Kolvisto’s hand, but there was no intent. 51 min I wonder if Denmark might try Harder down the middle at some point, either alone, or with a partner. She’s too much better than her teammates to be hoping the ball appears on her side. 50 min A better cross from Thomsen and this time Korpela spills it ... but quickly recovers to fall on the ball. 49 min Again the ball goes out Thomsen, and again the cross is a miserable one, flying behind. 48 min Finland have moved to a back five, which I guess denies Denmark space and perhaps allows them to attack space on the counter. 47 min Excellent from Harder off the bat, diddling Pikkuajamsa on the outside and squaring for Nadim ... but again, her finishing is hampered by rust as she tries to sweep towards the far corner, ballooning away from goal in the opposite direction. Best chance of the match so far – and by far. 46 min We go again, no changes to either side. During half-time, BBC screened VT highlighting the lack of diversity in women’s football in England. Hopefully this tournament does something to improve things, but ultimately we need funding from government and the wider game too. Noooooo! For those not as well-versed as I in the old Hollandish, this is what that means: Vivianne Miedema has unfortunately tested positive for COVID-19 and will therefore be in isolation for the next few days. When she no longer has any symptoms and tests negative, she can rejoin the selection. So hopefully she’s good for the knockouts, at least. Half-time reading: Finaldn have been solid, Korpela in particular, and Denmark have thinking to do. 45+2 min Nadim finds Harder who picks out Thomsen with a fine early ball; there’s time for the cross. But Thomsen, who’s had a poor half, can only waft behind. 45+1 min Korpela does well to flap the corner away, then from outside the box, Veje meets the loose ball and lamp behind. 45 min There’ll be two added minutes. 45 min Harder slips to Trige on her outside, but again, Korpela – who was also good against Spain – advances well, to smother behind before cross or shot can be attempted. 44 min Then Sevecke seeks Nadim, but Pikkujamsa intercepts. 44 min The corners finds Harder, whose cross is headed away; Oling will try a long throw... 43 min Pedersen lofts a nice ball out to Thomsen, still on the right, and her curling cross is a goodun. But Kuikka is alert enough to wave a leg that sends the ball behind. 40 min More directionless Denmark possession. 38 min Nice from Finland, Sainio making ground on the right and clipping a clever pass into the box that bisects two defenders, finding Kolvisto. So she tries to measure a cross into the middle for Oling, which is just too far in front of her and instead slips just past the far post. 37 min Bit of possession from Finland – they’re playing well. 35 min The corner comes to nothing, which is to say that Finland have done a decent job tightening up at the back. 34 min Now it’s Thomsen with a shot, but again Korpela does the necessary, turning behind. 33 min Best bit of play from Denmark so far, Nadim finding Bruun who returns the favour as Harder steps over, but the resultant shot trickles wide. 33 min Troelsgaard mooches through midfield and sends Harder in, but Kuikka does really well to stay with her which, along with a poor first touch, means Korpela can race out to smother. 31 min Almost all of Denmark’s best play has come down the right, but Thrige, responsible for much of it, has swapped with Thomsen. Perhaps Søndergaard thinks he can retain that from the former, while getting more from the latter. 30 min The corner comes to nowt. 29 min Better again from Denmark, again down the right; Sevecke finds Harder, who attacks the box from the side, but Pikkujamsa gets in the road, knocking the ball behind. 29 min Aaaarrrggghhh! Harder finds Thrige down the right and she’s loads of time to pick out a cross ... but sends an absolute dog straight to Korpela. 27 min Bruun takes possession in centrefield and drives forward, but she hangs on too long to feed in Thomsen on her outside so has no choice but to have a dig herself, lashing wide. 26 min Harder appears down the right, but her cross is easily seen off. Ultimately, sticking the ball in with only one striker waiting means it needs to be perfect to create anything. 25 min Denmark just aren’t moving enough to disconcert Finland’s defence, nor getting the ball to their attackers in space, so they can get a run on any of its members one on one. They’re also not switching play quickly enough, which means the opposing back four can just shuffle back or across. 23 min We’ve seen hardly anything of Harder - or Bruun for that matter. That’s partly because Finland are defending well, but also because her teammates aren’t finding her as they should be. 22 min Exhibit A: 21 min Interesting insight from elsewhere in this group. Miedema isn’t far off the best player in the world, and this is part of the reason why. 19 min Better from Finland, Franssi moving the ball down the left then inside to Sainio, who shifts is one more to Summanen, who drags her shot wide. 18 min “Great to see Nadim start!” emails Andy Grey. “Class player, seriously hoping she scores a goal as she’s just recovered from ACL rehab.” Yup, that injury at any age, never mind at 34, is a brutal thing. But she’s good enough to affect this tournament even though she won’t be whats she was, definitely not now and perhaps not ever again/ 17 min They do then get out, but Pikkujamsa can only hump a long cross towards the far side of the box, where Veje heads away easily. 16 min Denmark are dominating now, Finland sitting deep and struggling to progress beyond the confines of their own half. 14 min In that break, we see Korpela save again, and it was a better one that that for which I gave her credit. Nadim’s shot went of heel and foot, but the angle sent it pretty wide of the keeper, who had to dive then stretch again to push away. 13 min Ballisager heads Sallstrom, so there’s a break while she’s treated. 12 min “I’ve always thought that the lack of lyrics for a national anthem puts the team (eg Spain’s) at a huge advantage right at the start, says Charles Antaki. “Whatever nonsense the others have to sing, it’s going to come out either manic or lacklustre and musically atrocious one way or the other.” I’m not the best person to opine on this because I’m Jewish and our liturgy is full of wordless tunes with nye-nye-nyes replacing lyrics, so I’m naturally disposed to the proposal. 10 min Thrige again down the right and this time her cross is excellent, low, quick, and with Junge’s near-post stepover obfuscating its path from the defence. But Nadim, in the middle, doesn’t catch her shot properly, trying to guide it into the far bottom corner, so again Korpela saves. 9 min Lovely from Nadim, getting a run on Pikkujamsa and chucking a pair of lollipops before gliding on the outside, opening a shooting lane. Her effort is a decent one too, but it’s straight at Korpela who saves easily enough. 7 min Troelsgaard has Thrige outside and does pick the overlap, but the resultant cross is a poor one and Finland clear. 6 min Denmark have settled, now keeping possession better and picking up second balls. And as I write that, Harder is on the edge of the box with Sevecke outside her and no defender close. But she opts to shoot and is blocked at source. 4 min Email! “If we include teams with sweepers, there were a number of serious teams with back threes,” reckons Kári Tulinius. “Argentina’s 1986 World Cup winners spring to mind. As for this competition, I’ve found it very enjoyable. It’s threatening to be a classic tournament, though it’s still too early to tell.” To address your second point first, I couldn’t agree more – there are so many potential winners – and the only decent thing about the Qatar World Cup is that it gives this tournament centre stage. And yes, I guess if we allow sweepers we can also allow West Germany 1990. 2 min Finland start the faster and after Ballisager mops up a ball in behind, Kuikka wellies a shot well over the bar from roughly 69.51 yards. 1 min Our commentators are Mark Scott and Scott Booth, which reminds me of the old London Underground thing, Green Park, Park Royal, Royal Oak, Oakwood, Wood Green, Green Park. 1 min Peep! Peep! The players take the knee, then it’s off we go! Back to the managers, though, it’s quite a thing to say your players lost their bottle. I guess if the alternative explanation was that they were outclassed, it makes some kind of sense. There’s little better than footballers singing tunelessly, and Finland’s do not let us down. The players are with us! Anthem time! Anna Signeul, the Finland manager, says her players are ready and loved the atmosphere last time, while Lars Søndergaard, her Danish counterpart says his team lost its collective nerve against Germany, unable to find spaces with the ball and close them without it. So how do we feel about this tournament so far? England were superb last night, yet I couldn’t help but think about Argentina 6-0 Serbia from the group stages of the 2006 World Cup. It’s not often the best side in the first phase is the best side at the end. Next, they play the second-placed team in this group, and that will be a stern test, however much Spain miss the injured Putellas. On which point, in the history of football, how many properly serious teams have played three at the back? I can think of Van Gaal’s Ajax and Del Bosque’s Madrid, but after that I’m struggling. I guess we can allow Conte’s Juventus and Chelsea if we’re being generous. Something that might work for Finland: 4-4-2 is very decent antidote to 3-4-3 – even more so than 3-5-2 because you don’t even lose the numbers game in midfield. But that aside, it means the defenders have two attackers to deal with, not one, while on each flank, there’s a full-back and a wide player able to exploit the space behind the wing-backs and outside the back line. Anyone unacquainted with Nadia Nadim can address that situation here: As for Finland, with Hyyrynen inured, Kuikka comes in at centre-back and Pikkujamsa moves to to the left with Koivisto on the right while, on the right of midfield, Sainio is in for Engman. But what does it all mean? Denmark make two changes from the team walloped by Germany. On the right of midfield, Thrige comes in with Thomsen moving to the left and Svava dropping out, while Kuhl is also unavailable after being sent-off in injury time. And in attack, the heroic Nadim replaces Madsen. Denmark (3-4-3): Christensen; Sevecke, Ballisager, Veje; Thrige, Troelsgaard S ,Junge, Thomsen; Nadim, Bruun, Harder. Subs: Svane, Nielsen, Boye Sorensen, Holmgaard K, Holmgaard S, larsen, Bredgaard, Madsen, FGevitz, Gejl, Svava. Finland(4-4-2): Korpela; Kolvisto, Westerlund, Kuikka, Pikkujamsa; Sainio, Alanen, Summanen, Oling; Sallstrom, Franssi. Subs: Talaslahtim Tamminen, Auvinen, Ahtinen, Kemppi, Heroum, Danielsson, Kollanen, Rantanen, Rantala. It’s a problem not entirely of their own making – they didn’t draw themselves in a group with Germany and Spain – but whichever way you look at it, these teams are in trouble. If there’s a loser here, they’re almost certainly going home – bad for them, yes, but for us? Let’s get it on! Finland actually started their game against Spain nicely, taking the lead and missing a decent chance to double the advantage. They ended up taking a hiding nevertheless, and will be particularly disappointed that, of the four goals they conceded, three were headers and the other a penalty. On the other hand, though, those are aspects of play that can be tightened up with a little more focus, and if that happens, they’re a live dog in this match. Denmark, meanwhile, started the competition with more significant hopes than the rank outsiders. Though only four of the XI that lost the 2017 final began against Germany – the year-long delay helped some teams and hindered others – the incredible Pernille Harder remains in her prime, capable of winning any game on her own.

article13,‘Zero asylum seekers’: Denmark forces refugees to return to Syria,2022-05-25 11:00:34,"['Denmark', 'Refugees', 'Europe', 'Global development', 'World news', 'Syria', 'Middle East and north Africa']","Maryam Awad is 22 and cannot remember the last time she had a good night’s sleep. It was probably before her application to renew her residency permit as a refugee in Denmark was rejected two years ago, she says. Before 2015, Awad’s family lived in a small town outside Damascus, but fled to Denmark after her older brother was detained by the regime. The family have been living in Aarhus, a port city in northern Denmark, for eight years. Awad and her younger sister are the only family members facing deportation. Their situation is far from unique. In 2019, the Danish government notified about 1,200 refugees from the Damascus region that their residency permits would not be renewed. Unlike the United Nations and EU, Denmark judged the region to be safe for refugees to return. However, as men could be drafted into the army and older women often have children enrolled in Danish schools, the new policy predominantly affects young women and elderly people. Lisa Blinkenberg, of Amnesty International Denmark, said: “In 2015, we have seen a legislative change which means that the residency permit of refugees can be withdrawn due to changes in their home country, but the change does not have to be fundamental. Then in 2019 the Danish immigration services decided that the violence in Damascus has stopped and that Syrians could be returned there.” Blinkenberg says Denmark’s policy towards asylum seekers and refugees has become notably more hostile in recent years. “In 2019, the Danish prime minister declared that Denmark wanted ‘zero asylum seekers’. That was a really strong signal,” she says. “Like in other European countries, there has been a lot of support for rightwing parties in Denmark. This has sent a strong signal for the government to say: ‘OK, Denmark will not be a welcoming country for refugees or asylum seekers.’” Awad smiles, briefly, for the first time when she receives a phone call from her lawyer. He tells her there is now a date set for her appeal with the refugee board. It will be her last chance to prolong her residency permit. She had been waiting for this phone call since February. “I am really nervous, but happy that it is happening,” she says. “I am glad that I had the support from friends who put me in touch with volunteers. If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t know what to do.” One of the volunteers Awad has received help from is Rahima Abdullah, 21, a fellow Syrian refugee and leader of the Danish Refugee Youth Council. Over the past two years Abdullah had almost single-handedly built a network of opposition to deportations targeting Syrians. “I have lost count of how many cases I worked on. Definitely over 100, maybe even 200,” Abdullah says. Abdullah, who grew up in a Kurdish family in Aleppo, first became politically active at 16 after her family sought refuge in Denmark. She has been regularly publishing opinion pieces in Danish newspapers and built a profile as a refugee activist. “The image of immigration in Danish media was very negative. I could see everyone talking about it but felt as if I didn’t have a voice. That’s why I decided to become an activist,” she says. In 2019, Abudullah and a classmate, Aya Daher, were propelled to the front pages of Danish media, after Daher found herself among hundreds of Syrians threatened with deportation. “Aya called me up, scared, crying that her application was rejected. Before we were thinking about finishing school, about exams and parties, but suddenly we were only concentrating on Aya’s future and her safety,” Abdullah recalls. “I posted her story on Facebook and I sent it to two journalists and went to sleep. In the morning I found that it was shared 4,000 times.” The story was picked up by local and international media, sparking a public outcry. Following her appeal to the Danish Refugee Board, Daher’s residency was extended for an additional two years on the grounds that her public profile would put her in danger from the Assad regime. “They gave me a residency permit because I was in the media. They did not believe in what I said about my situation and the dangers I would face in Syria. That really hurt,” Daher says. “I hope I don’t have to go through this process again.” “Aya can get on with her life now, but I am still doing the same work for other people in the same position,” Abdullah says. “Her case showed refugees that, if you get media attention and support from society, you can stay in Denmark.” Abdullah gets up to five messages a day from refugees hoping she can help them catch the attention of the media. “I have to choose who to help – sometimes I pass people on to other activists. There are two or three people helping me,” she says. “It gets hard to be a young person with school and a social life, with all that work.” But not everyone is as appealing to the media as Daher. The people whose stories pass unnoticed keep Abdullah up at night. “I worked with one family, a couple with young children. I managed to get them one press interview in Sweden, but it wasn’t enough,” Abudullah says. “The husband is now in Germany with two of the children trying to get asylum there. The wife stayed here with one child. She messaged me on Facebook and said: ‘You did not help us, you destroyed our life.’ I can’t be angry at her – I can’t imagine how she feels. “Aya’s story was the first of its kind at the time. Additionally, Danish media like to see an outspoken young woman from the Middle East, who is integrated into society, gets an education, and speaks Danish,” Abdullah says. “And this was just an ordinary Syrian family. The woman didn’t speak good Danish and the children were quite young. “Aya also doesn’t wear a hijab, which I think made some people more sympathetic towards her,” Abdullah adds. “There are people in Denmark who think that if you wear the hijab you’re not integrated into society. This makes me sad and angry – it shouldn’t be this way.” Daher, who became the face of young Syrian refugees in Denmark, says: “It was very difficult to suddenly be in the media, and be someone that many people recognise. I felt like I was responsible for a lot of people. “I had a lot of positive reactions from people and from my classmates, but there have also been negative comments.” she says. “One man came up to me on the street and said ‘go back to your country, you Muslim. You’re stealing our money.’ “I respect that some people don’t want me to be here. There’s nothing more I can do about that,” Daher says. “They have not been in Syria and they have not been in the war – I can’t explain it to them.” Awad hopes she can return to the life she had to put on hold two years ago. “I don’t know how to prepare for the appeal. All I can do is say the truth,” she says. “If I go back to Syria they will detain me.” She hopes this will be enough to persuade the board to allow her appeal. “I planned to study medicine in Copenhagen before my residency application was rejected. I wanted to be a doctor ever since I came to Denmark,” she says. The uncertainty prompted her to get a qualification as a health assistant by working in a care home. “I just want my life back.”"
article14,Spain’s Marta Cardona sets up England tie after late strike sinks Denmark,2022-07-16 21:04:48,"[""Women's Euro 2022"", ""Denmark women's football team"", ""Spain women's football team"", 'Football', 'Sport', ""Women's football""]","There were twenty-five seconds remaining when at last the nerves fell away and they knew. Marta Cardona leapt at the far post to meet Olga Carmona’s cross, guiding a header into the net and Spain into the quarter-final, substitutes and staff liberated and streaming from the bench to greet her. It had been edgy and far from easy but they had done it, setting up a meeting with England. Denmark, ultimately, had not quite done enough. Lars Søndergaard’s side, led by Pernille Harder, had sought their moment, the single goal they needed to go through, but it was Spain that eventually got it. The Danish manager had admitted that his side would have less of the ball, prepared to protect and counter. There had been times when it looked like the plan might pay off, especially in the first half and it took a superb late save by Sandra Paños, whose mistake had been so costly against Germany, to see Spain through. In the end though Denmark fell short, wondering what might have been. “They had teary eyes,” Søndergaard said of his players. “We had the chances, it was so close. But that’s how it is: it’s the group of death [and] unfortunately we were the ones that died but we fought for our lives.” Jorge Vilda’s players live to fight another day, two substitutes combining to get the breakthrough. “We deserved it, even if we weren’t at our best,” Aitana Bonmatí said. To begin with Denmark’s 4-5-1 unfolded fast and to good effect, Denmark quick and direct, Janni Thomsen finding space into which to advance, Kathrine Kühl impressing and Harder increasingly difficult to control. It was her dash that almost set up Karen Holmgaard and she who raced clear to lob wide in an impressive opening. Next she outran Mapi León to draw a near post save from Paños. Denmark had begun well, Katrine Veje’s run leading to Thomsen falling under challenge from Athenea del Castillo and appealing for a penalty, and Spain looked decidedly uncomfortable. Slowly, though, they gained some control, Mariona Caldentey heading over and Ona Batlle delivering a ball from which Del Castillo couldn’t get a clean contact. If Spain rarely made clear openings, they might have led when a lovely exchange set up Caldentey. That time Lene Christensen had to make a sharp stop; a moment later from a looping, gentle cross she could only get a finger on the ball, a scramble ensuing. Irene Paredes’s header was then cleared off the line. Still there was no way through for either side, Paredes blocking Rikke Madsen’s shot at the start of the second half –and that was the way it would play out, almost to the very end. Spain continued to seek the goal that Denmark needed with Carmona, one of three changes at the break, hitting the side netting. The shift would prove decisive, but it would take a long time to reveal that. A draw would see Spain through, they knew, but if time was theoretically on their side and the ball was almost exclusively theirs now, the margins narrowed and the nerves grew. “We only had two minutes of calm,” Vilda said afterwards. Not surprisingly with Harder on the prowl, another long ball seeing her singlehandedly taking on three defenders and hitting over. If Denmark were struggling to get possession and seemingly accepting that they might get only one shot, she is certainly good enough to take it. Increasingly alone, with twenty minutes remaining, Søndergaard decided the time had come to accompany her, Nadia Nadim and Stine Larsen were introduced. The impact was almost immediate and the moment might have been Nadim’s before it was Cardona’s. Harder made it, again making something of not much, rolling her marker and laying off brilliantly. Nadim’s rising shot was pushed away by Paños. Although that was the last time Denmark mustered a shot, that didn’t release the tension during the ten minutes that remained. Only Cardona could do that, eventually."
article15,Denmark Vesey’s Bible review: searing history with lessons for a troubled America ,2022-07-02 07:00:39,"['Books', 'History books', 'Race', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Culture']","In America, it would seem we have arrived at a moment when the “good book” has supplanted our constitution. Unambiguously conceived by the founders, once broadly considered admirable, the separation of church and state is deemed, as the supreme court justice Samuel Alito might put it, “egregiously wrong from the start”. This is what makes reading Jeremy Schipper’s new book, Denmark Vesey’s Bible, so instructive. When religion is allowed to overcome and nullify the rule of law, Schipper shows, unless one is an adherent to “the right faith”, one is liable to be out of luck. Beyond the sons of Ham and the people of Kush, one does not get much mention of Africans in scriptural texts. But this hardly stoped Denmark Vesey finding himself and his people there anyway. Born either in West Africa or the Caribbean sometime around 1767, this zealous revolutionary was enslaved in his early teens by Joseph Vesey, a trafficker in enslaved people. Capt Vesey settled in Charleston. Trained as a carpenter, the enslaved man won $1,500 in a local lottery and obtained his freedom for $600. Financially secure, proficient in several languages, Denmark Vesey’s involvement in the African Church, a forerunner of today’s Emmanuel African Methodist Church, led to his radical liberation theology. Leading evening classes, he saw an opportunity to help Black people still in bondage, including his own children, far more profoundly than by repeating the admonitions of white clergy. Not for him were paradoxical quotations like “Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters” (Ephesians 6:5) or “Servants, obey in all things your masters” (Colossians 3:22). Instead, like many Black leaders who followed, Vesey adopted the Bible as a playbook for salvation and freedom. George Santayana had yet to warn the world that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. But organizing the most ambitious grassroots armed insurrection ever planned, to free the enslaved people of Charleston, South Carolina and relocate them to Haiti, Vesey and his collaborators knew this lesson well. Their’s was a test which still resounds. A late friend, the Harlem sage Grafton Trew, said: “Frederick Douglass told my grandfather it was plain to Vesey that in Biblical times, God’s chosen people, the Jews, were Niggers. Privileged elites, back then, the Romans and Egyptians, they were the masters and tyrants. He figured it was the same in his day, that slave masters were God’s enemies.” Vesey read the exodus story of Israelite slaves triumphing over their Egyptian masters as mandate and compact. At Mount Sinai, Moses declared: “He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death” (Exodus 21: 16). As Trew said Douglass put it, “For Vesey, more than any mere directive, this was a Divine injunction.” He took particular note of a biblical command for the annihilation of Jericho’s residents, in Joshua 6:21: “And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.” Thomas Jefferson had warned of such a calamitous chain of events. “And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep forever: that considering numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation, is among possible events: that it may become probable by supernatural interference! The Almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a contest.” Engineered with the strictest discipline and a tightly organized leadership, Vesey’s planned rebellion was nonetheless betrayed by two men not even at the periphery of the plot. So beguiled were so many self-satisfied masters by their presumed benevolence and their slaves’ corespondent “loyalty”, that had they fled, the plotters might have gotten away. Hastily arrested, trials swiftly followed. On 2 July 1822, Vesey and five alleged ringleaders were hanged. By summer’s end, 29 more enslaved men were executed. How quickly many lessons of America’s revolution were lost. Without the delusional-seeming examples of entreatments by George and Martha Washington and others, beseeching “well-cared-for … and much esteemed” escaped enslaved people to return “home”, one could hardly believe the attitude of Charleston’s elite. Assuming that the Bible endorsed slavery, many seemed to regard Black people they held in bondage as not so different from dogs they might keep as pets. In this they were as much avowedly imperialist as King George III. What vexed them most seemed to be the ingratitude of these men, enslaved and formerly enslaved. Sentencing Vesey and his co-conspirators to death, the magistrate Lionel Henry Kennedy railed at their risk of “everything” for a hopeless cause. Condemning them, he took particular exception to their “perversion of the holy word of God”. If among all its excellence Denmark Vesey’s Bible has one fault, it is, I’m afraid, an unavoidable one. Unable to consult the long-lost papers of Vesey and his colleagues, their letters or diaries, Schipper must simply draw them out from the shadows of time as best he can. In 1863, recruiting Black men for the Union army during the civil war, Douglass declared “Remember Denmark Vesey of Charleston!” In our time of trouble, Schipper bids us also to recall Vesey’s worthy example. Concluding his work, he asserts: “The enduring but contested question of what the Bible implies in the context of American white supremacy continues to be a matter of life and death.” Denmark Vesey’s Bible: The Thwarted Revolt That Put Slavery and Scripture on Trial is published in the US by Princeton University Press"
article16,‘There is a lot of excitement’: Tour de France comes to Denmark,2022-06-27 04:00:02,"['Tour de France', 'Denmark', 'Cycling', 'Europe', 'Sport', 'World news']","Cycle paths have been painted yellow, knitting enthusiasts have made a giant yellow jersey, and preparations are being made for a flotilla of boats flying yellow flags. The “big yellow party” comes to Denmark on 1 July when the country widely regarded as the best in the world for cyclists hosts the opening stage of the world’s greatest cycling race. The Tour de France was originally slated to start in Copenhagen in 2021, but was transferred to Brest in response to a Covid-related scheduling conflict with the European Championships. Postponing the Grand Départ Copenhagen by a year has been welcomed as allowing more time for planning and now, post Covid lockdowns, organisers are hoping their investment of 150m Danish krone (about £17.3m) will boost tourism. “There is a lot of excitement in the city,” said Sophie Hæstorp Andersen, a cycling fan and lord mayor of Copenhagen, where a huge clock in the city’s main square is counting down to 1 July. “We’re gearing up for a big yellow party where everyone’s invited,” said Andersen. Denmark’s reputation as a cycling nirvana is well-earned. There are approximately 7,500 miles of bike routes and bike lanes across the country and half of all Copenhageners commute by bike. Cycling enthusiasts in Copenhagen can try out the Tour de France route themselves on 2 July, when the professionals set off for stage two from Roskilde Cathedral, where the Viking king Harald Bluetooth is said to be buried. After a windswept sprint across the Great Belt Bridge, the route finishes in Nyborg on the island of Funen. The third and last Danish stage on 3 July starts in the city of Vejle – known as The Kingdom of Cycling thanks to its Alpine-grade ascents shaped by the ice age in an otherwise remarkably flat country. The route will take in Vejle’s harbour, with buildings designed by the artist Olafur Eliasson, as well as the Unesco world heritage site at Jelling, where Bluetooth raised the Jelling Stone in 965 CE, marking the unification of Denmark as a Christian nation. Cyclists will pass through Kolding, celebrated for its 750-year-old royal fortress Koldinghus, as well as another Unesco world heritage site at Christiansfeld before finishing 113 miles later in Sønderborg. A total of 5,000 volunteers will be involved in keeping the festivities going countrywide, but Vejle municipality has taken an interesting approach to building engagement. “We wanted the community to feel ownership of the event instead of just commissioning projects,” said organiser Jacob Rasmussen, “so we set up a 3m Danish krone grant fund for innovative projects that celebrate cycling”. Tour de France Vejle is headed up by an unassuming man in shorts named Lars Ulrich – a physiotherapist and bike enthusiast who has spent his entire life explaining that he is not the drummer from Metallica. Ulrich was tasked with getting non-cyclists excited about the race. “I thought, ‘how can I make this an historic event? How can I get it to be remembered for anything other than tight Lycra pants?’ Covid separated us for so long that Tour de France is an opportunity to come together – I want everyone involved.” Alex Slot Hansen, an employee at Sydbank, invested in 9,000 balls of wool for the residents of local hospices and care homes to knit a giant 600kg yellow jersey to be raised up at the harbour. “I had a lot of messages from carers who say it’s been therapeutic for hospice patients in particular,” said Hansen. Morten Teilmann-Jørgensen from the Viking Kings experience centre came up with “the Viking Biking Escape Box”. “You get in a box on a stationary bike and you see yourself on a screen,” said Teilmann-Jørgensen. “There are virtual ‘Vikings’ behind you, and when you start cycling, they start chasing.” Restaurateurs and retailers are bracing themselves for the city to double in size, with 100,000 visitors from around the world expected. Ulrich and his team have been emphasising the importance of hospitality to local businesses and how to be a good host – something that doesn’t necessarily come naturally in a country not famed for its service culture. Maria Theresa Olsen from Bryg coffee house in Vejle hopes to confound expectations. “I’m trying to think, ‘if I were a tourist what would I want?’ and ‘how can I give a good impression of this town I’m proud to call home?’’ she said. “The eyes of the world will be on us, so we want to give as good as experience as we can.” The one element of the experience no one can plan for is the weather and Denmark’s unpredictable summers make counting on sunshine futile. “I’m checking the forecast daily and crossing my fingers,’ said Hæstorp Andersen, “but it’ll be what it’ll be”. Ulrich takes a more upbeat approach: ‘It’s like we always say in Denmark: ‘There’s no such thing as bad weather – just the wrong clothes’.’"
article17,Denmark PM decries ‘cruel and senseless’ Copenhagen shooting as thousands attend memorial,2022-07-06 00:53:32,"['Denmark', 'Europe', 'Gun crime']","Thousands have gathered in Copenhagen to pay tribute to the victims of a weekend shopping centre shooting that left three people dead, including two teenagers. “Cruel, unjust and senseless. Tonight, we all mourn,” the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, told the massive crowd that gathered on Tuesday outside the Field’s shopping complex, where the attack occurred. Frederiksen called for unity in the face of the tragedy. A boy and a girl, both aged 17, and a 47-year-old Russian man who lived in Denmark were killed, and at least four people were injured after a gunman opened fire at the busy Copenhagen shopping centre on Sunday. The late afternoon shooting shook the city, which had just hosted the opening stages of the Tour de France cycling competition and seen the return of the Roskilde music festival after cancellations because of Covid-19. “It’s not hard to imagine, ‘what if it was my child?’ – I’m the mother of two teenagers,” the Copenhagen mayor, Sophie Andersen, said during an address, which was followed by a moment of silence. “Children and young people should not die. They should be immortal,” Andersen added. Denmark’s Crown Prince Frederik also attended the service, where speeches were interspersed with musical performances. “We stand together in this difficult time,” Frederik said. The mood was sombre, with some crying among the many families and young people who had gathered. “I’m quite ambivalent. Of course it’s nice to see all these people who are here to support the people who have been hurt by this action, but I’m also a little scared,” Oliver Stoltz, who works in a sporting goods store at the shopping centre, said. The 24-year-old was at Field’s – located between the city centre and the capital’s airport – when the shooting started and heard the first shots ring out. “This used to be a place where I can go work, be happy and have a good time. Now I dread even coming out here to this part of town.” The alleged perpetrator of the attack, a 22-year-old Danish man who authorities say was known to mental health services, was remanded in custody in a closed psychiatric ward on Monday on murder charges. Police said on Tuesday they had no new information to release about the investigation. The Field’s shopping centre has been closed since the attack and is expected to reopen on July 11. Denmark’s largest cinema chain also kept all its movie theatres closed because the 17-year-old boy killed in the attack worked in the cinema in the shopping centre. Nordisk Film Biografer said on Facebook that the company made the decision out of respect for the victims and “to talk the situation through with our staff”.

article18,Copenhagen shooting: suspect charged after three killed in Denmark shopping centre attack,2022-07-04 00:18:18,"['Denmark', 'World news', 'Europe']","Danish police have said three people were shot dead and three critically injured after a gunman opened fire at a busy Copenhagen shopping centre on Sunday evening. A 22-year-old Danish man was arrested after the shooting, Copenhagen police inspector Søren Thomassen said. The suspect has been charged with manslaughter and will face questioning in front of a judge on Monday. The suspect was known to police “but only peripherally”, Thomassen said on Sunday evening. The victims included a man in his 40s and two “young people”, he added, without giving further details. Several others were injured, three of them critically, he said. The suspect was apprehended at 5.48pm local time while carrying a rifle and ammunition, said investigators. Police launched a massive search operation throughout the local Zealand region early Sunday evening in search of any accomplices. “We are going to have a large investigation and a massive operational presence in Copenhagen until we can say with certainty: he was alone,” Thomassen said. Thomassen said it was too early to speculate on the motive for the shooting, which happened at Field’s, one of the biggest shopping malls in Scandinavia and located on the outskirts of the Danish capital. The investigation so far did not point towards a racist motive or otherwise, but this could change, the police chief said. The capital’s main hospital, Rigshospitalet, has called in extra staff, including surgeons and nurses, a spokesman said. In a series of tweets earlier on Sunday, police said they had sent officers to Field’s, after receiving reports of a shooting. Police were present in large numbers, they added, advising people inside the centre to stay put and await assistance. Images on social media that could not be immediately verified showed police running into a building and getting dressed in protective gear. Danish broadcaster TV2 published a grainy photo of the alleged gunman, a man wearing knee-length shorts, a vest or sleeveless shirt, and holding what appeared to be a rifle in his right hand. Other footage posted online showed people running through and out of the mall and TV2 also posted a photo of a man being put on a stretcher. Witnesses said people were crying and hiding in shops. Several fire vehicles were parked outside the mall. Police have appealed for anyone who has seen, heard or filmed anything to contact them. “Denmark was hit by a cruel attack on Sunday night. Several were killed. Even more wounded. Innocent families shopping or eating out. Children, adolescents and adults,” prime minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement late on Sunday. “Our beautiful and usually so safe capital was changed in a split second,” she said. “I want to encourage the Danes to stand together and support each other in this difficult time.” The Danish royal family spoke of their shock at news of the attacks. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathy are with the victims, their relatives and all those affected by the tragedy,” said Queen Margrethe, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary in a statement. “The situation calls for unity and care, and we would like to thank the police, the emergency services and the health authorities for their quick and effective efforts during these hours.” Laurits Hermansen told Danish broadcaster DR that he was in a clothing store at the shopping centre with his family when he heard “three or four bangs. Really loud bangs. It sounded like the shots were being fired just next to the store.” Other witnesses quoted by Danish media said they had seen more than 100 people rush towards the mall’s exit as the first shots were heard. “We could see that many people suddenly ran towards the exit and then we heard a bang. Then we ran out of Field’s too,” Thea Schmidt, who was in the mall at time of the attack, told TV2. Field’s shopping centre has 135 shops, cafes and restaurants. The mall is just across from a subway line that connects the city centre with the international airport. A major highway also runs adjacent to Field’s. A concert by British singer Harry Styles, which was due to take place at the Royal Arena less than a mile from the mall, was cancelled on Sunday evening despite earlier reports that it would go ahead. On Snapchat, Styles wrote: “My team and I pray for everyone involved in the Copenhagen shopping mall shooting. I am shocked. Love H.” Shortly after the shooting, the royal palace said a reception with Crown Prince Frederik connected to the Tour de France cycling race had been cancelled. The first three stages of the race were held in Denmark this year, the palace said in a statement. The reception was due to be held on the royal yacht that is moored in Sønderborg, the town where the third stage ended. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report"
article19,Canada and Denmark end decades-long dispute over barren rock in Arctic,2022-06-14 14:02:16,"['Arctic', 'Canada', 'Denmark', 'Greenland', 'World news', 'Americas', 'Europe']","It has been described by some as a “pseudo-confrontation”, and by others as a diplomatic afterthought. Now, however, the so-called “whisky war”, which was never really a conflict at all, has finally been resolved with the formal division of a tiny barren Arctic island between Canada and Denmark. Sitting in the Kennedy Channel of Nares Strait between the north-western coast of the semi-autonomous Danish territory of Greenland and Canada’s Ellesmere Island, the uninhabited half-mile-square Hans Island has no mineral resources nor much else of interest unless you are a visiting seabird. Shaped like a muffin and surrounded by cliffs, it was for centuries an Inuit hunting ground. Crucially, however, it has been at the centre of a long-running border dispute between Canada and Denmark – via Greenland’s home rule government – with Copenhagen claiming that geological evidence points to Hans Island being part of Greenland – a claim rejected by Ottawa. Canada and Denmark agreed in 1973 to create a border through Nares Strait, halfway between Greenland and Canada. But they were unable to agree which country would have sovereignty over Hans Island, which lies about 680 miles (1,100km) south of the north pole. In the end they decided to work out the question of ownership later. That prompted largely good-natured advocacy between the two parties, including adverts posted on Google promoting their claims, and flag-raising stunts. The “whisky war” reference came about after Denmark’s minister of Greenland affairs raised a Danish flag on the island in 1984, buried a bottle of Danish schnapps at the base of the flagpole and left a note saying: “Welcome to the Danish island.” Canadians planted their own flag and left a bottle of Canadian whisky. Since then, the countries have in turns hoisted their flags and left bottles of various spirits in tit-for-tat moves. In 2002, Nana Flensburg was part of a Danish military crew that stood on the cliff to perform a flag-raising ceremony. The Politiken newspaper on Tuesday quoted her as saying in her diary that “among the stones in the cairns were lots of bottles, glasses, etc with documents that informed about previous visits to the island”. At the height of the rivalry, both sides took to buying ads on Google to make their claim after Denmark said it would send a letter of protest over a visit in 2005 by Canada’s then defence minister, Bill Graham. Graham stated Canada had always owned the island, prompting Denmark to respond: “Hans Island is our island.” Some Canadians in turn proposed a boycott of Danish pastries, in an echo of the way some Americans rejected “french fries” when France declined to join coalition forces in Iraq. Now the friction is being brought to an end with the two countries agreeing to divide the tiny island between them under an agreement to be signed later on Tuesday. “It sends a clear signal that it is possible to resolve border disputes … in a pragmatic and peaceful way, where the all parties become winners,” said the Danish foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod. He said it was “an important signal now that there is much war and unrest in the world”. The agreement will enter into force after the two countries’ internal procedures have been completed. In Denmark, parliament must give its consent to the agreement. • This article was amended on 16 June 2022. An earlier version described the liquor left on Hans Island by Canada as brandy, rather than whisky."
article20,Hard cheese: EU court scolds Denmark over feta labels in win for Greece,2022-07-14 16:58:41,"['Greece', 'Cheese', 'Denmark', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'Food', 'World news']","Twenty years after feta cheese was recognised as exclusively Greek, the EU’s highest court has gone one step further and announced that Denmark would be breaking the law if it continued to allow dairies to sell counterfeit feta outside the bloc. In Athens, the news elicited immediate glee. “This is a wonderful day for authentic feta cheese,” said Christos Apostolopoulos, who heads the Association of Greek Dairy Industries, which produces 80% of the country’s stock. “We are very pleased and delighted. Our complaints have finally been heard.” Greece has long argued that it has history on its side. The crumbly white cheese, most commonly a mixture of sheep and goat’s milk, was first recorded in the eighth century BC and was referenced by Homer in the Odyssey. Aristotle is said to have delighted in its distinctive taste and texture. A staple of the ancient world, it has been an integral part of Hellenic cuisine ever since, topping traditional Greek salads and filling traditional Greek pastries, not least the cheese and spinach pies that line the shelves of most bakeries. No tavern would be worth its salt, or brine, if feta wasn’t on its menu. “There is almost no table [of patrons] that doesn’t order it,” said Ioannis Filokostas, president of the union of restaurateurs in Thessaloniki, Greece’s northern metropolis. “The European court’s logic was totally right. History has proved that it is clearly a Greek product and for us this is clearly a good decision. Why should Denmark rip off our product?” Prior to the ruling, Athens’ agriculture ministry had described the tangy cheese as an iconic creation of the country. Feta was awarded the appellation of being a designated Greek product with a protected designation of origin, or PDO, by the EU executive in 2002 – a move that many had thought would give it legal security among member states. But neither that, nor outrage in Greece, has stopped Denmark exporting its own “feta” to non-EU territories, with Copenhagen countering that the export ban was tantamount to an obstacle to trade. In 2019 the dispute deepened after the commission decided to take the case to the European court of justice, the bloc’s top tribunal, with the support of Athens and Nicosia. Three years later, judges at the Luxembourg-based court delivered their verdict. On Thursday they pronounced that with its stance, Denmark was hindering not only the right of Greek producers to a fair income, but the EU’s own position in talks with trading partners. “By failing to stop the use of the designation ‘feta’ for cheese intended for export to third countries, Denmark has failed to fulfil its obligations under EU law,” they said. Earlier this year the court had given a foretaste of Thursday’s decision when its advocate general, Tamara Capeta, counselled that Denmark was in breach of European law by labelling white cheese exports “feta”. “Feta was registered as a protected designation of origin (PDO) in 2002,” Capeta was quoted as saying in March. “Since then, the name ‘feta’ can be used only for cheese originating in the specified geographical area in Greece and complying with the relevant production specification.” An estimated 30,000 Greek farmers produce about 130,000 tons of feta annually, according to data kept by the Association of Greek Dairy Industries. “Our organisation accounts for about 95% of our total exports,” Apostolopoulos said. “What Denmark has been doing is a total fraud. The only way its companies can continue selling the product is if they call it ‘white brined cheese’.” The Danes have marketed their “feta” since 1963, manufacturing the cheese from pasteurised cow’s milk. In Greece, feta is produced either from unpasteurised sheep’s milk or a mixture of sheep and goat’s milk, then curdled with rennet. Greek dairies have spotted Danish imitation feta being sold as far afield as Australia, itself home to a large Greek diaspora. “Their cheese has reached markets across the Middle East, Africa and Australia,” said Apostolopoulos, expressing fears that Danish multinationals would continue making the cheese in production units established outside the EU. In recent years Greek exports of feta have increased dramatically, and more than 65% of total output is now sold overseas. “I think we can fulfil some of [those markets’] needs with authentic feta cheese,” noted Apostolopoulos. “It’s very important that we begin bilateral discussions with countries that host these factories to make clear that they are in breach of EU laws if they continue producing fake feta cheese.” • This article was amended on 28 July 2022. Greek farmers produce about 130,000 tons of feta a year, not 130 tons as an earlier version said."
article21,Russia cuts gas supplies to Netherlands and firms in Denmark and Germany,2022-05-31 18:25:07,"['European Union', 'Netherlands', 'Gas', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Energy industry', 'Business', 'Europe', 'Gazprom', 'Commodities', 'Oil and gas companies', 'Oil']","Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe, after state energy giant Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification of the economic battle on Tuesday over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine follows the EU’s overnight decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports as part of its financial sanctions against the Kremlin. EU leaders said the ban would immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, rising to 90% by the end of the year. Gazprom extended its gas cuts on Tuesday by stopping supply to GasTerra, which buys and trades gas on behalf of the Dutch government. It later said it would also cut off gas flows to the Danish energy firm Ørsted and to Shell Energy for its contract to supply gas to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles. GasTerra said it had found contracts elsewhere for the supply of the 2bn cubic metres of gas it had been expecting to receive from Gazprom between now and October. Ahead of the late-night talks in Brussels, Denmark had signalled it expected its Russian gas supply to end. However, Ørsted said on Monday that a gas cut would not immediately put the country’s gas supplies at risk. Moscow has already halted supplies of natural gas to Bulgaria, Poland and Finland, after they refused to pay in Russian roubles. Gazprom said it had been told by Shell Energy Europe Limited that it would not pay in roubles for gas supplied to Germany. It added that the contract stipulated gas supplies of up to 1.2bn cubic metres per year. Gazprom said Shell and Ørsted had failed to pay for gas deliveries by the end of the working day on May 31, and would stop deliveries until they paid in line with Russian demands. The Kremlin had demanded payments for exports in roubles earlier in the spring, after the country’s currency fell off a cliff after the invasion of Ukraine and Russia was excluded from the Swift international bank messaging system in earlier rounds of sanctions. The EU’s energy commissioner had previously said that member states would have to reject Moscow’s demands, as the mechanism set out by Russia would have breached the bloc’s sanctions, even if this left them without alternative gas supply. Supply cuts have pushed already high gas prices even higher, contributing to soaring inflation, and also putting pressure on European governments and companies to find alternative supplies and infrastructure, including storage facilities. The EU has faced criticism over the past weeks for not going far enough in its sanctions against Russia. Ahead of Monday’s summit in Brussels, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin. Under a compromise plan from the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for use by Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo. Despite this agreement, Estonia’s prime minister has called on the EU to go further and work on a seventh round of sanctions against Russia, which would include restrictions on gas imports. However, Kaja Kallas said she was not confident this would happen. “I think that gas has to be in the seventh package but I am realistic as well,” Kallas told reporters as she arrived for a second day of talks in Brussels. “I don’t think it will be there.”"

It’s goalless between Austria and Denmark in Vienna after 15 minutes. Ah well, at least the lights are on. 84 mins: France led Denmark 1-0 and lost – could it happen again? Kimpembe betrays some tension, clattering Sucic in midfield and earning a yellow card. Kramaric takes it, waits for Maignan to move, and rolls the ball into the other corner. A gift from Clauss, and Croatia are level! Penalty to Croatia! The referee points to the spot after Kramaric’s heels are clipped by Clauss, seconds after the defender came on. But no – he’s now whistled for an offside in the build up. VAR takes another look – and the penalty is given! 79 mins: Modric is taken off, replaced by Salzburg’s Luka Sucic. West Ham’s Nikola Vlasic is on too, replacing Kovacic. For France, Jonathan Clauss replaces Diaby. 75 mins: Big chance for France, who spring that wonky Croatian offside trap again. Griezmann is in space to the right of goal, but his shot is beaten away by Livakovic, who then collects his attempted cross towards Nkunku. The teams have kicked off in Vienna, just the 90 minutes behind schedule. 70 mins: Modric makes a dazzling cameo, shimmying into space on the edge of the area and curving a shot on goal. Maignan gets across to push it away. 67 mins: Kramaric comes on for Budimir, who missed a decent chance in the first half and has faded since ... “Austria-Denmark will apparently start at 10.15pm,” says Lars Bøgegaard. So any minute now, then. Croatia make some changes too, with Mario Pasalic and Mislav Orsic replacing Brekalo and Majer. 60 mins: Changes for France, with new Villa recruit Boubacar Kamara replacing Tchouameni for his international debut. Antoine Griezmann is on for Ben Yedder, who did very little but did set up the goal. 58 mins: Croatia are pushing forward again, but still struggling to find a cutting edge. Budimir tries to get on the end of a cross, but he is marshalled well by Kimpembe. We are still waiting to see if the game can get under way in Vienna. That’s the news you’re all anxiously waiting for, isn’t it? Croatia had started the half on the front foot, but it’s France who take the lead. Adrien Rabiot latches on to Ben Yedder’s through ball down the left, and fires the ball first-time inside the near post! GOAL! Iceland 1-1 Albania Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson has levelled things from a corner in League B, Group 2. That group, by the way, is a three-team affair with Russia disqualified. Israel are the other side in the group. Peep! The second half is under way in Split. No changes for either side, which is something of a surprise. “Watchable?!” bellows John Ryan. “There’s been three shots, it’s brutal. Bring on France’s first-choice front three at half time or this shambles will take 90 plus minutes of our life we’ll never get back.” I mean, it’s not unwatchable ... It’s also half-time in Reykjavik, where Albania lead Iceland 1-0. Elsewhere: Belarus 0-0 Azerbaijan, Slovakia 0-1 Kazakhstan, Andorra 0-0 Moldova. An enjoyable half of football ends goalless, with Christopher Nkunku seeing an effort disallowed and chances spurned by both teams. Still not under way in Vienna, where dark has now descended. You wonder if that game will kick off at all, at this stage. Meanwhile in Andorra, Moldova’s Victor Stina has been sent off – giving the hosts a chance for a famous win. 40 mins: Vida’s slip almost lets Diaby in from Nkunku’s pass, but the winger carries the ball a little too wide and Livakovic saves from an angle. Moments later, Tchouameni strikes from distance and forces the Croatian keeper into another spritely save. GOAL! Iceland 0-1 Albania Taulant Seferi sweeps the ball home to give Albania the lead in Reykjavik. NO GOAL! Nkunku thinks he has fired France in front, but after a pitchside VAR check, the referee rules it out for offside! We have a goal! Kazakhstan lead Slovakia 1-0 in Trnava. Aslan Darabayev is the man on the scoresheet. Back in Split, Brozovic is penalised for clattering the unfortunate Nkunku. 23 mins: Nkunku is OK to continue – which will be a relief to his many summer suitors at club level. The free kick is whipped towards another wanted man, Tchouameni, who steers his shot wide at the back post. 20 mins: Vida goes in the book for a heavy challenge on Nkunku, who is still down holding his leg. It was a clumsy hack, but made worse by the pitch, with the French forward’s boots catching in the surface. Still no kick-off time in Vienna, with the problem apparently extending to a wide area beyond the stadium. It’s goalless in all the games under way; in the early kick-off in League D, Latvia beat Liechtenstein 1-0. The French setup looks pretty fluid, with Digne dropping into left-back off the ball. They’re also playing a very high line, and it almost costs them here as a simple through ball puts Budimir in the clear. He tries to draw Maignan out of goal, but the keeper stands firm and blocks his shot. One game hasn’t started on time: the match in Vienna has been postponed due to a power outage. No word yet on when, or if, they’ll get under way. Six minutes gone in Split, where Majer has just dragged a shot wide from Modric’s corner. The other games kicking off at 7.45pm are Iceland v Albania (League B), Belarus v Azerbaijan and Slovakia v Kazakhstan (both League C), &amp; Andorra v Moldova (Group D) ... Peep! We’re about to get under way in Split, Vienna and beyond. One fan in Split tonight has sent me this photo. Fans are still queuing to get in outside the ground, with kick-off under 15 minutes away. Here’s Ben Fisher on Wales’ journey from the wilderness to the World Cup: Austria (4-1-4-1): Pentz; Trimmel, Posch, Alaba (c), Friedl; Selwald; Laimer, Schlager, Ljubicic, Baumgartner; Kalajdzic. Subs: Lindner (GK), Fraisl (GK), Trauner, Danso, Arnautovic, Sabitzer, Weimann, Gregoritsch, Wöber, Onisiwo, Lainer, Lázaro. Denmark (4-2-3-1): Schmeichel (c); Andersen, Nelsson, Vestergaard, Mæhle; Højbjerg, Jensen; Kristensen, Eriksen, Braithwaite; Poulsen. Subs: Iversen (GK), Vindahl-Jensen (GK), Delaney, Skov Olsen, Boilesen, Damsgaard, Billing, Stryger, Wass, Skov, Cornelius. Not entirely sure how Didier Deschamps will set up tonight – looks like a potential 3-5-2 with Digne and Diaby as wing-backs, but Uefa have it as a more conventional 4-2-3-1, with Rabiot pushing forward. For the hosts, Luka Modric is back in the starting line-up, and wins his 150th cap for his country tonight. Osasuna forward Ante Budimir and Rangers full-back Borna Barisic are also brought into the side by Zlatko Dalic. Croatia (4-3-3): Livakovic; Juranovic, Erlic, Vida, Barisic; Modric, Brozovic, Kovacic; Majer, Budimir, Brekalo. Subs: Labrovic (GK), Ivusic (GK), Vrsaljko, Sutalo, Pongracic, Kramaric, Vlasic, Sucic, Pasalic, Jakic, Orsic, Ivanusec. France (3-5-2): Maignan; Pavard, Saliba, Kimpembe; Diaby, Guendouzi, Tchouaméni, Rabiot, Digne; Nkunku, Ben Yedder. Subs: Lloris (GK), Areola (GK), Konaté, Koundé, Griezmann, Mbappé, Coman, Kamara, Clauss, Benzema, Lucas Hernandez, Theo Hernandez. The third edition of the Nations League is a full-throttle affair – the final four will be set by September, and four of the six rounds of group games will be played in the current two-week window. There have been some eye-catching results already, leaving big teams a matter of days to turn things around – and get some kind of momentum going before November’s World Cup in Qatar (yes, it really is happening). France, the Nations League holders, are one such team – the home defeat to World Cup group-mates Denmark has put them in a tight spot before tonight’s game in Split. The same goes for their hosts, Croatia, who were tonked 3-0 by Ralf Rangnick’s Austria. It will be a long way back for whoever loses this re-run of the last men’s World Cup final in 2018, which honestly feels about 10 years ago, doesn’t it? Meanwhile, Austria and Denmark will meet in Vienna in a battle for control of *checks notes* Group A1. Kasper Hjulmand’s team look poised to replace Croatia as the side each and every pundit picks to “go on a run” at the World Cup. Austria aren’t going to Qatar, but you might argue that their first result under Rangnick was more impressive than anything he did at Manchester United. But wait – there’s more! In League B, Iceland host Albania ... OK, there may not be more. Should still be fun though. Kick-off in tonight’s games: 7.45pm (BST)."
article23,Denmark accused of racism after anti-ghetto law adapted for Ukrainians,2022-05-02 12:18:04,"['Denmark', 'Race', 'Ukraine', 'Refugees', 'Migration', 'World news', 'Europe']","Denmark is facing fresh claims of racism after MPs changed the country’s controversial anti-ghetto law to allow Ukrainian refugees to move into social housing emptied of “non-westerners”. For three years, the government has sought to restrict immigrants from moving into what are described as disadvantaged neighbourhoods in an attempt to avoid so-called “parallel societies”. Access to social housing, some of which has been earmarked for demolition, has been shut off to “non-westerners”, defined as being people from outside the EU, eight associated European countries, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. People born in Denmark but who have a single “non-western” parent have also been included in the category of people subject to the restrictions. However, after the Danish government’s decision to take in 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, a majority of the Danish parliament voted on Thursday to amend the law to exempt Ukrainians from such restrictions. Plans to demolish social housing in the targeted areas have also been put on hold to free up accommodation for Ukrainians. Susheela Math, a litigation officer at the Justice Initiative, a campaign group against forced evictions in the so-called ghettos, said the law change proved the parallel society law was racially discriminatory. She said: “The laws underlying the evictions of tenants living in ‘vulnerable housing areas’ and the state’s volte-face on measures such as demolitions and housing allocations, show that the ‘ghetto package’ was clearly meant to target non-white individuals. “These discriminatory measures do not serve any public good and clearly exacerbate the shortage of affordable housing in Denmark. Many of the racialised residents being evicted are Danish and identify strongly with their Danish identity, having been born in or lived in these so-called ghetto areas for years. “These neighbourhoods are their homes. Some of these individuals were refugees themselves and have fled conflict and persecution – no differently than Ukrainians now fleeing war. The discriminatory treatment that they have been subjected to stands in stark contrast to the rightfully compassionate welcome that Ukrainian refugees have received in Denmark.” The anti-ghetto law was first proposed in March 2018 by the Liberal minority government, which introduced the political plan “One Denmark without parallel societies – no ghettos by 2030” and enacted the concept of “non-western” in Danish law. The Social Democratic prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has continued the policy since coming to power in June 2019 although the word ghetto has been removed from the latest legislation. The neighbourhoods targeted have more than 1,000 residents and more than half of residents are of “non-western” origin. They must also meet two of four criteria: more than 40% of residents are unemployed; more than 60% of 39- to 50-year-olds have no upper secondary education; crime rates are three times higher than the national average; and residents have a gross income 55% lower than the regional average. Twelve neighbourhoods currently fall into that category. In these areas, misdemeanours also carry double the legal penalties in place elsewhere and daycare is mandatory for all children over the age of one, or family allowances are withdrawn. Majken Felle, a resident of Mjølnerparken, a neighbourhood designated as a “ghetto” area, said she was convinced the parallel societies policy was driven by bigotry. She said: “Recently, a representative from Bo-Vita, the organization responsible for the redevelopment of Mjølnerparken, said in an interview that in neighbourhoods like mine, there is an Arab mentality and residents do not care about western culture, making these areas feel potentially unsafe to Ukrainian refugees. “He is saying out loud what is the unspoken intention behind the permanent removal of homes in ‘ghetto’ areas: that these policies and demolition projects are driven by racial prejudice.” According to Statistics Denmark, 11% of Denmark’s 5.8 million inhabitants are of foreign origin, of whom 58% are from a country considered “non-western”."
article24,"Austria 1-1 France, Denmark 0-1 Croatia: Nations League – as it happened",2022-06-10 20:53:03,"['Nations League', 'Football', 'Sport']","A1 Austria 1-1 France Denmark 0-1 Croatia B2 Albania 1-2 Israel Russia P-P Iceland C3 Azerbaijan 0-1 Slovakia Belarus 1-1 Kazakhstan D1 Moldova 2-4 Latvia Andorra 2-1 Liechtenstein Thanks for reading this Clockwatch. Nighty night! Despite tonight’s defeat, Denmark remain top of A1 with six points. Austria stay in second, equal on four points with Croatia but ahead of them thanks to the head-to-head rule. (They won their first game of this group 3-0 in Osijek last week.) France are now bottom with just two points, though at one stage this evening an eight-point deficit on the leaders Denmark was a genuine possibility; now it’s just four, and the world champions will still fancy themselves to turn this round. Croatia haul themselves off the bottom of Group A1 with a shock victory in Copenhagen! We’re into injury time in Copenhagen. Croatia have done extremely well to hold firm, especially when you consider their centre backs had one cap between them before tonight. Martin Erlić had that; Josip Šutalo is on debut tonight. France battered Austria for the entire second half, but only got their equaliser late, and despite nearly going on to win the game themselves, were very close to losing it at the very end. What a fine game of football! ... then in Vienna, Austria nearly snatch it at the death! Karim Onisiwo is sprung free down the right, and he’s got Michael Gregoritsch clear in the penalty box! But he overcooks the pass infield. Gregoritsch can’t reach what should have been a simple tap-in! Drama too in Copenhagen, where Andreas Skov Olsen latches onto a flick-on and forces the ball under Dominik Livaković and in. But the goal is chalked off by VAR for offside, correctly so. As the clock ticks into injury time in Vienna, Mattéo Guendouzi flicks a header goalwards from a left-wing corner. Patrick Pentz hacks clear off his line. He’s made a series of sensational saves this evening, and is surely Austria’s man of the match. Kevin Danso comes sliding in on Christopher Nkunku from behind. That was very nearly an ugly scissor tackle on Nkunku’s standing leg. He’s rather lucky that he’s just booked. Nkunku is fortunate that Danso didn’t connect, and that his leg is still in working order. Karim Benzema, Christopher Nkunku and Kylian Mbappé suddenly spark into life just to the left of the Austria D. Some high-speed triangles, a couple of backflicks, and suddenly Mbappé powers into the box, clear of everyone! He goes for the top-left again -exactly as he did for the goal - but somehow Patrick Pentz gets a little something on the shot, deflecting it onto the bar, the ball twanging away at warp speed. What a goal that would have been! It’s fair to say France deserve their equaliser on the balance of play. They probably deserve to find a winner, too, given the level of their second-half dominance. There’s enough time! France had lost a little momentum, but now look! Ibrahima Konaté plays calmly out from the back. Kylian Mbappé plays a quick one-two with Christopher Nkunku, and he’s clear! He strides into the Austria box and lashes an unstoppable riser into the roof of the net. What a finish ... and what a return pass by Nkunku, who rolled it down the inside-left channel at perfect speed for Mbappé to run onto without breaking stride. A free kick for Denmark out on the left. Christian Eriksen swings it in. Martin Braithwaite heads harmlessly over. Meanwhile in Vienna, France debutant Ibrahima Konaté - who has scored a couple of big goals for Liverpool this season - heads harmlessly over the bar from a corner. Schmeichel effs and jeffs. But that had been coming. The corner came about after Luka Modrić’s free kick, swung in from the left, caused all manner of trouble. As things stand, Austria will be tied with Denmark on points at the top of A1 this evening! A corner for Croatia on the right. Luka Modrić pulls it back for Marcelo Brozović, who curls into the box. Andrej Kramarić flicks a header on. The ball drops to Mario Pašalić, six yards out. Pašalić sticks out a leg and rams the ball under Kasper Schmeichel and in! France continue to come at Austria from all angles. Kylian Mbappé bothers the hosts down the right with his pace; Kingsley Coman comes over and doubles up. The Austrian defence are earning their money tonight. France are pinging it around in a frenetic manner. Austria are holding their shape, though, just about ... but suddenly captain David Alaba goes down and performs the internationally recognised mime for Sub Me Now. A most unwelcome development for the hosts. France win a series of corners. A sense that an equaliser is in the post. Inevitable substitutions dept. France have sent on Kylian Mbappé, while Marko Arnautović has finally succumbed to his back injury. ... so having said that, Modric finally shows up, grooving down the right and standing one up for Andrej Kramarić, free, six yards out. His cross is a couple of millimetres too high. Very close to opening the scoring. Denmark are still enjoying the greater share of possession in Copenhagen, despite the arrival of the magician Modric. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg goes up for a header against Dominik Livaković, and beats the keeper to win it, but the whistle goes as he looks to tap the dropping ball into the unguarded net. Then Højbjerg has a lash from distance. It flies inches wide of the left-hand post. It’s French attack versus Austrian defence in Vienna at the moment. The hosts are struggling to get out of their final third. Coman really should have scored back there. Yep. Stefan Lainer, on a booking and having already had a talking-to by the ref, is replaced by Valentino Lazaro. But there’s no immediate change in the direction of play. First up, Benjamin Pavard warms Patrick Pentz’s hands with a long-distance rake. Then Pavard crosses from the right. Antoine Griezmann takes the ball off Karim Benzema’s head, and it skims to Kingsley Coman, who has the ball at his feet, ten yards out. He’s got time, and the whole of the goal to aim at ... but blazes over. A lot of French heads being held in hands right now. Kingsley Coman turns Stefan Lainer this way and that down the left, but can’t find Antoine Griezmann alone in the middle. France have picked up the pace. It looks as though Ralf Rangnick is considering a change to nix their momentum. Nothing’s happening for Karim Benzema yet. He meets a dropping ball on the left-hand corner of the Austrian six-yard box, and creams a volley, but Gernot Trauner bravely gets in the road, and nothing comes of the resulting corner. Denmark and Croatia are up and running again in Copenhagen. Danger for the Danes: Luka Modrić and Mateo Kovačić are on! Stefan Lainer, who has already been booked, clatters clumsily into Kingsley Coman. The French midfielder is quick to remind the referee of Lainer’s disciplinary status. The ref wags his finger at Lainer in performative fashion, but nothing more. We’re underway again in Vienna. Marko Arnautović hasn’t succumbed to his injury yet. Didier Deschamps hasn’t resorted to Kylian Mbappé yet. Half-time to-do list. 1. Sign up for Fiver 2. That’s it The half-time scores in tonight’s other Nations League games ... B2: Albania 0-0 Israel C3: Belarus 0-1 Kazakhstan D1: Andorra 0-0 Liechtenstein ... and the full-times from earlier ... c3: Azerbaijan 0-1 Slovakia D1: Moldova 2-4 Latvia Denmark have done most of the attacking, Croatia the lion’s share of the defending. And here we are. As things stand, Denmark will end the evening at the top of A1, one point clear of Austria, five clear of Croatia, and six clear of the world champions France. Andreas Weimann’s first goal for Austria is the difference right now in Vienna. Stefan Lainer powers down the Austrian right. He loops in low for Marko Arnautović, who attempts to spin and slot into the bottom left. Arnautović doesn’t quite catch it, and Hugo Lloris claims. France counter, and Karim Benzema once again tests Patrick Pentz, aiming a curler towards the top right. Once again, the Austrian keeper sticks up a strong arm to turn the ball out for a corner, from which nothing comes. France are in a spot of bother now. If they can’t get back into this match, and should the leaders Denmark win in Copenhagen, they’d be eight points behind the Danes with just three matches to play. On the bench, Kylian Mbappé looks signally unimpressed, arms folded tightly with face in harrumph mode. Andreas Weimann gets his first goal for Austria at long, long last! Marko Arnautović, battling on bravely, works his way down the inside-right channel before rolling a pass to Konrad Laimer on the overlap. Laimer pings it infield instantly, and the 30-year-old Weimann, winning his 17th cap ten years after his debut, can’t miss! He dispatches into the bottom left, giving Hugo Lloris no chance whatsoever. Marko Arnautović is struggling with an injury. He’s way off the pace, and he has his pocket picked on the edge of his own box by Boubacar Kamara, who tees up Karim Benzema. The Real Madrid striker whistles a shot straight down Patrick Pentz’s throat. Scrappiness breaks out across Europe. A continent-wide blight. A ball’s looped into the French box from the right. Andreas Weimann is in space on the penalty spot, but he wants far too much time, and is eventually barged out of it by Benjamin Pavard. Weimann wants a penalty, but Austria are just getting a corner, from which Stefan Lainer floats a header into the arms of Hugo Lloris. Croatia go up the other end and win their first corner. It’s worked back up the left flank for Mislav Oršić, who swings deep for Andrej Kramarić at the far stick. Kramarić cushions the ball, producing something that’s neither a cross nor a shot, and the Danes clear. Good chance, that. In Copenhagen, Joachim Andersen has the ball at his feet, a little to the right of the penalty spot. He aims for the top-right corner, only for his shot to be deflected out for a corner. From that, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg høicks over from the edge of the box. Both matches are ticking over at an agreeable rate. France are beginning to dominate in Vienna. They’re stroking the ball around in a very pretty style, and with great speed. Austria are struggling to get out of their own half at the minute. Nicolas Seiwald joins Stefan Lainer in the referee’s notebook after sliding hysterically through Moussa Diaby. From the resulting free kick, keeper Patrick Pentz fumbles on his own line, the ball breaking to Karim Benzema. You’d back Benzema to slot the gift from six yards, but Pentz makes up for his error by sticking up a strong hand to make a sensational reaction stop. His team-mates hack clear. Croatia finally show in attack, Mislav Oršić cutting in from the left and hoicking over the bar. “Did Kasper wave, point and otherwise bring attention to the hole, similar to a defender not doing their job?” wonders Joe Pilcher, who has it down in one. Aurélien Tchouameni, soon to grace Real Madrid’s midfield, takes a shot from distance. He gets plenty behind it, but it’s always rising over the Austrian bar. Meanwhile in Copenhagen, Christian Eriksen slips a delightful pass down the inside-left channel to release Joakim Mæhle, who slams a poor effort into the side netting. He should at least have worked Dominik Livaković in the Croatian goal. Andreas Cornelius is in the thick of it in Copenhagen. First he blazes wildly over the bar from the edge of the Croatian box, then he’s booked for an over-zealous aerial challenge on goalkeeper Dominik Livaković, who requires some treatment after being whacked upside the head. The first corner of the evening in Vienna is forced by Maximilian Wöber, who worms his way down the left with great purpose. Austria load the box. William Saliba heads it clear. France go up the other end through Kingsley Coman, who is unceremoniously brought down from behind by Stefan Lainer. The Austrian right-back goes into the book. Meanwhile they’re up and running now in Copenhagen. You know, that may well have been the first-ever sight of a length of cable tie at a football match without an environmental protester attached to it. The first big chance in Vienna, as Andreas Weimann dances through the middle of the French defence and into the box. But before he can pull the trigger, Theo Hernández makes a fine last-ditch challenge, then the flag goes up for offside. A short delay in Copenhagen as Denmark keeper Kasper Schmeichel spots a minor defect in the net of the goal he’s guarding in the first half. On comes a dude to repair it with a bit of cable tie. What drama here, huh. The teams are out! Austria, who play in red these days, take to the field with les bleus of France at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna. Denmark, in yet another tasteful red and white Hummel number, trot out at the Parken in Copenhagen alongside Croatia, in second-choice black. We’ll be off in a minute! While we wait for kick-off, how about some retro kit action. First up, the Austrian Wunderteam of 1934 ... ... and the coqs of the walk (in Adidas) at Euro 84. Meanwhile there’s only really one place we can go regarding Denmark ... ... while another style icon made its first appearance on the world stage 12 years later. Denmark: Schmeichel, Andersen, Mæhle, Christensen, Delaney, Eriksen, Skov Olsen, Damsgaard, Wass, Cornelius, Højbjerg. Croatia: Livaković, Vrsaljko, Šutalo, Kramarić, Brozović, Pašalić, Jakić, Oršić, Ivanušec, Erlić. Juranović. Andreas Christensen, now formerly of Chelsea, returns for Denmark. Christian Eriksen, in the shop window, captains, while Martin Braithwaite starts on the bench. Croatia leave a couple of big guns on their bench in Mateo Kovačić and Luka Modrić. Austria: Pentz, Trauner, Seiwald, Arnautović, Alaba, Sabitzer, Weimann, Wöber, Laimer, Lainer, Schlager. France: Lloris, Pavard, Konaté, Griezmann, Tchouameni, Coman, Kamara, Saliba, Benzema, Diaby, Hernández. Marko Arnautović and Andreas Weimann return up front for Ralf Rangnick’s Austrian. Ibrahima Konate of Liverpool makes his debut for France, while new Aston Villa signing starts for the first time. Kylian Mbappé is on the bench. We’ve got some A1 entertainment lined up for you this evening. Literally A1, it’s Group A1 of the Nations League, which means this ... Austria v France Denmark v Croatia ... though there are three other matches tonight as well: Albania v Israel in B2, Belarus v Kazakhstan in C3, and Andorra v Liechtenstein in D1. We plan to concentrate on world champions France, who are in a spot of bother after losing at home to Denmark and being held in Croatia, though you never know how these things pan out, so let’s just see where the mood takes us. All five games kick off at 7.45pm BST. It’s on!"
article25,"Belgium 1-4 Netherlands, France 1-2 Denmark: Nations League – as it happened",2022-06-03 20:50:33,"['Nations League', 'Football', 'Sport']","Thank you very much for joining me. A lovely roundup will soon drop. Full-time results Croatia 0-3 Austria France 1-2 Denmark Kazakhstan 2-0 Azerbaijan Belarus 0-1 Slovakia Latvia 3-0 Andorra Liechtenstein 0-2 Moldova Belgium 1-4 Netherlands Mr Jolly strikes again. Netherlands: good, Belgium: bad, Boyata: atrocious. A wonderful night for the Danes and Cornelius. Who cares? Belgium 0-4 Netherlands: I still can’t believe Roberto Mancini used to pick Boyata over Nedum Onuoha. “Boyata has been a weak link in the ‘Golden Generation’ for some time,” says Dan Christmas. “All those excellent players, but Belgium just needed one or two more very good players to really look world class. If that makes sense...” He’s been ruddy awful. France 1-2 Denmark: Hojberg is caught late and looks in a lot of pain on the deck. France 1-2 Denmark: A chance for an immediate equaliser as an unmarked Rabiot sends a weak header straight at Schmeichel. Speaking of ... Cornelius races onto a pass over the top, takes a couple of touches while holding off the defender and whacks the ball into the roof of the net. France 1-1 Denmark: The Danes are looking good going forward ... France 1-1 Denmark: Kante takes aim from 30 yards, curling his shot beyond Schmeichel but the ball bounces back off the post. Belgium 0-4 Netherlands: The ball is in the back of the net. Batshuayi is found the wrong side of the defence, he shovels the ball at goal but Cillesen saves it, only to see Castagne tap home. The celebrations are muted as Batshuayi knows what VAR confirms: he is offside. Belgium 0-4 Netherlands: De Bruyne looks pretty annoyed to still be on the pitch for this shitshow. France 1-1 Denmark: What a save! Olsen cuts in from the right and hammers a left-footed shot from 25 yards which Lloris flings himself at to stop it going into the top corner. Boyata is having a stinker. Blind sees space to run into, he heads a long ball into the path of Depay, who is in about 10 yards of space as Boyata has completely lost him, and he volleys home. The big man stays onside to volley a looped ball over the France defence. The Benzema goal for UK readers ... Belgium 0-3 Netherlands: To be fair to Belgium, De Bruyne did announce beforehand that he did not care about these matches. Ban football in June! All over in Brussels. Berghuis curls a shot from the edge of the box which Mignolet palms into Blind’s path from where he crosses for Dumfries to tap home a third. Belgium 0-2 Netherlands: Cillesen finally makes a save! A lovely through ball reaches Trossard who thwacks a shot at goal from inside the box but the goalkeeper is behind it. Belgium 0-2 Netherlands: Belgium are currently playing like a team who find the Nations League beneath them. Thoughts are prayers with my good friend James who is recovering after eating some reheated rice on Wednesday. France 1-0 Denmark: Varane is the latest France player to hit the deck. He looks like a man who has just remembered he is a Manchester United defender as he awaits treatment. Looks live he might have knacked his calf. Belgium 0-2 Netherlands: Vertonghen pings a bicycle kick well over the bar from six yards. “I don’t disagree that technology has moved on, but I’m still not sure I see the point of non-alcoholic beer?” asks Tom Hopkins. “There are so many other flavours to explore, why stick with the same on drinking and non-drinking nights? “Sorry, I was trying to come up with another example of a weak, watery version of something vital for comparison, but I’m coming up blank.” I think it’s the reassuring nature of it. I also do not actually often drink beer at home. Depay races into space vacated by Boyata and whips a shot almost through Mignolet. WHAT A GOAL! The striker dribbles into the box from the right flank, plays a quick one-two, then bamboozles three defenders with ludicrously quick feet before slotting into the corner. Incredible stuff from an incredible player. Belgium 0-1 Netherlands: Mertens, who came on at half-time, makes an instant impact by scraping his studs down Blind’s calf to earn a booking. “Your choice of halftime refreshment makes me realise that the Nations League is kind of like non-alcoholic beer,” Peter Oh says. “Not horrible, but not very good either. A bit of a funny aftertaste, and none of the feeling you associate with the real thing. Something you wouldn’t choose but could put up with given no other options.” You should get hold of some Adnam’s Ghost Ship 0.5%. France 0-0 Denmark: Benzema volleys from close range but Schmeichel makes himself big to repel the Frenchman’s effort and the defenders scramble the ball away. Here we go again! With France v Denmark live on Box Nation in the UK, I fear what channel are showing Liechtenstein v Moldova. Good Food? Over the past 10 years, I think the improvement in non-alcoholic beer and over chips, really has changed the world for the better. Just having a non-alcoholic beer and a piece of brownie. I am living the platinum jubilee dream. Kári Tulinius emails: “I’m not saying I’m having a hard time staying engaged, but I started reading the Wikipedia entry on the Belgian stadium’s namesake, and it’s never a good sign, ethics-wise, when one of the subsections is about another person’s murder. Nice goal, mind you, by some Dutch guy. Enjoy the match!” I AM DOING MY BEST. An emotional 45 minutes concludes around Europe. France and Denmark is still goalless but we do have a goal in Belgium. Scores: Croatia 0-1 Austria France 0-0 Denmark Result: Kazakhstan 2-0 Azerbaijan Belarus 0-0 Slovakia Result: Latvia 3-0 Andorra Liechtenstein 0-1 Moldova Belgium 0-1 Netherlands France 0-0 Denmark: Mbappe is on the turf looking relatively dejected while shaking his head. He gets to his feet but doesn’t look happy and is wandering around the pitch. He seemed to hurt himself with no one around him ... Belgium 0-1 Netherlands: Dumfries gets down the right and crosses into the box. The ball whacks Castagne in the face and the referee awards a penalty. It goes to VAR who instruct the referee to go over to the monitor and he rightly overturns it. “If I were Timber I would sign for Forest over United, for obvious reasons,” says Peter Oh. I think Forest are in favour of keep trees up, not cutting them down. A wonderful strike from Bergwijn. He receives he ball with his back to goal 30 yards from goal, turns, gets it out of his feet and fires a powerful shot into the corner. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: De Bruyne has an opportunity to shoot from a free-kick 25 yards from goal. He lifts the ball over the wall but straight into Cillesen’s hands. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands. The Dutch are on top - the home fans are even starting to boo. Depay is the latest to let fly but his dipping shot bounces safely into Mignolet’s hands. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: Another chance for Berghuis. Bergwijn lays the ball off to an onrushing Berghuis but he curls a rising shot high and wide. We are past the half-hour mark and only Liechtenstein v Moldova has a goal. France 0-0 Denmark: Mbappe drives inside from the left and looks to curl a shot around Schmeichel but he can only find the goalkeeper’s chest. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: Berghuis does well down the left flank and takes his time to pick out Blind. He takes a touch and fires across goal but his shot goes inches wide. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: Trossand replaces Lukaku. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: Lukaku’s race is run. He is sat on the turf and does not fancy carrying on. He was a doubt before the match. I would not have bothered picking him in such a game. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: It is so hot in Brussels, they need a cooling break. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: Lukaku goes down in the vicinity of Ake but it is a blatant dive. Poor from the big man. VAR takes a look at the incident thinking there might be a red card. Lukaku pushed Ake a little but nothing more than that. Odd. “These Nations League games became useless and absolutely unnecessary when Germany and other Group A teams were supposed to be relegated to Group B,” Yash Gupta says. “Instead UEFA said Hell no, that’s not going to happen. Maybe UEFA saw the appeal behind Super League. These games are nothing more than glorified friendly now.” Thanks for following this live coverage. France 0-0 Denmark: Maehle clears the ball down the line but gets clobbered in the face by Kounde, to leave the Dane on the deck. Liechtenstein 0-1 Moldova: A huge goal for the Moldovans. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: De Bruyne gives the ball away and Netherlands makes the most of the error. Berghuis runs through to be one-on-one with Mignolet, the Dutchman goes across the goalkeeper but his shot loops off the former Liverpool man’s foot and just over the bar. France 0-0 Denmark: Benzema finds the back of the net after latching onto a cute through ball but the flag goes up pretty quickly, especially by modern standards, and the goal is rightly ruled out. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: Ake dispossesses Lukaku in the box but his clearance only reaches an onrushing Castagne who whacks a shot towards goal, only to see it ping back off the bar. France 0-0 Denmark: A cross reaches Benzema waiting on the penalty spot but his first-time shot is blocked. The best opening of the match thus far. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: “Saw your comment ten mins ago [19.41],” says Charlie Swinbourne. “Wonder if this might be due to people with colour blindness - seeing the difference between red and orange is difficult. No idea if that’s the reason but wouldn’t surprise me.” I have no issue with the reasoning but then surely Netherlands should be in their away kit and Belgium still in red. France 0-0 Denmark: Some nice buildup play from France concludes with Griezmann pinging a low drive from 30 yards but Schmeichel gets right behind it. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: Eden Hazard, starting his first game since January, just about has the pace to reach a De Bruyne pass over the top, allowing him to loop a cross into the box but Netherlands do well to clear. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: Chris Iwelumo is on co-comms. He is impressed with Timber’s physicality. A first tick for the Premier League there. Belgium 0-0 Netherlands: A bright start from both sides in Brussels. They have already looked pretty threatening. Hopefully this is the sign of a good game. Peep! Peep! Peep! Belgium are in all white, while Netherlands are in their famous orange. I am very much against home teams needlessly wearing their away kits. Sky Sports must have really not cared about showing these games. I am sure they used to have the rights. Good job I have worked out how to mirror Premier Sports onto my TV ... I am not saying the Nations League hasn’t caught the public’s imagination but France v Denmark is live on Box Nation tonight. Timber starts for Netherlands. Ten Hag is very keen on reuniting with the Ajax defender at Old Trafford. Will be interesting to see how he copes tonight. Turns out Spain played Portugal last night. France: Lloris, Lucas Hernández, Varane, Koundé, Theo Hernández, Tchouameni, Griezmann, Kanté, Coman, Mbappé, Benzema. Denmark: Schmeichel, Andersen, Nelsson, Vestergaard, Maehle, Hojbjerg, Delaney, Wass, Eriksen, Olsen, Dolberg. Belgium: Mignolet, Vertonghen, Boyata, Alderweireld, Castagne, Witsel, De Bruyne, Meunier, Hazard, Lukaku, Vanaken Netherlands: Cillessen, Timber, Van Dijk, Ake, Dumfries, Berghuis, Klaassen, de Jong, Blind, Bergwijn, Depay. Jonathan Wilson on Ukraine. Today’s fixtures: Croatia v Austria France v Denmark Result: Kazakhstan 2-0 Azerbaijan Belarus v Slovakia Latest: Latvia 1-0 Andorra Liechtenstein v Moldova Belgium v Netherlands Belgium will need an inspirational team talk prior to their match against the Netherlands, because, according to Kevin De Bruyne: “The Nations League is unimportant. We have to play those matches, but it’s a kind of practice campaign.” Now that you are all in the mood for some hot June football action, we can take a closer look at the big match at The King Baudouin Stadium. Thibaut Courtois misses out after suffering a groin injury during the Champions League final, not that he will mind too much. Netherlands could give a start to Manchester United target Jurrien Timber, allowing Red Devils (this works on two levels) to have a closer look at the Ajax defender. Elsewhere, the Stade de France plays host to Denmark. There will be plenty of spotlight on policing and strategies for getting fans into the ground following the chaos at the Champions League final last week. Surely the police and other authorities will manage to be slightly less incompetent on this occasion. France head coach Didier Deschamps will be absent following the death of his father. “He will be back soon. You have to respect his grief, he is with his family who needs him,” assistant Guy Stephan said. We will keep across the other games, too, but they look pretty underwhelming."
article26,The day the music died? Welcome to Denmark Street and Tottenham Court Road’s new ‘digitally enabled streetscape’,2022-08-07 10:00:41,"['Architecture', 'Art and design', 'London', 'Cities', 'Culture', 'UK news']","Once upon a time, just outside Soho in central London, there was a legendary hive of musical energy. It was centred on Denmark Street – Britain’s Tin Pan Alley – a strip of shops selling instruments and sheet music, with clubs and bars and such things as production facilities and agents’ and managers’ offices on the upper floors, where new-in-town fans and nascent musicians could mingle with stars. Everything to do with music – writing, producing, performing, listening, selling – could be done within its short length. An almost endless roll call of greats made music there: Lionel Bart, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, George Michael, the Libertines, Adele, Ed Sheeran. The young David Bowie, desperate to be in the street where it happened, camped there in a converted ambulance. The Sex Pistols launched their career from a Denmark Street flat. Just across Charing Cross Road, in Soho proper, was the London Astoria, a venue big enough for 2,000 people. Many hundreds of millions of pounds’ worth of construction later, there is still a street of musical instrument shops, plus new venues and production facilities, plus a “radical new technology-driven marketing, entertainment and information service housed in a super-flexible, digitally enabled streetscape”, plus much else. There will be “busking points” and clubs. The Astoria has gone, but a new 600-seat theatre called @sohoplace is on the way, on a site next to where it stood. On paper, then, its mix of uses is like that of the past, but in spirit it is utterly changed. It is built on the obvious paradox that a culture fuelled by rebellion and chaos should now be channelled through the processes of large property owners. Anarchy in the UK it is not. Or, rather, it is a new kind of scaled-up anarchy, where the boys making all the noise are big businesses. The catalyst for this extravaganza is the Elizabeth line, the supersized, speeded-up, £18.9bn underground railway that opened last May, whose station at Tottenham Court Road can disgorge 200,000 passengers a day. Its construction required the demolition of the Astoria and other buildings, clearing the site for new development. It brings crowds of potential punters to the doorstep of the areas of new venues, who will fuel Outernet London, a billion-pound “immersive entertainment district”, “where music, film, art, gaming and retail experiences come to life in new breathtaking ways”. This “district” is in fact a single project, albeit one incorporating some historic fragments, in the ownership of one company, Consolidated Developments. Its most conspicuous feature is the Now Building, a big oblong block that greets you when you exit the tube: a giant, table-like frame clad in black stone, within which multistorey gold-coloured shutters can fold back to reveal an atrium lined with 23,000 square feet of floor-to-ceiling high resolution LED screens. Other spaces in the complex also surround visitors with screens. You will be greeted with a storm of digital light and motion in what Consolidated say will be “London’s Times Square”. Beneath the Now Building is a new 2,000-capacity venue, Here at Outernet, opening in September. Behind it there is Chateau Denmark, a hotel “inspired by Denmark Street’s rare hustle”, where, for £456 a night and upwards, you can stay like a rock star in “session rooms” decked out in mahogany and burgundy velvet and “antique brass” and “industrial concrete”, pre-vandalised with curated graffiti. And on the southern side of the same block there is Denmark Street itself, where the old guitar shops – thanks in part to some encouragement from Camden council – have been invited to continue their business in its refurbished buildings, plus a “grassroots music venue” formed in the old 12 Bar Club. Outernet CEO Philip O’Ferrall calls his project “the world’s largest, most advanced atrium of content … a disruptive, atomised brand engagement platform”, by which he means that companies will pay handsomely to put their brands on the big videos, and to hold spectacular events in the screen-lined rooms. The idea is to entice the public in and then get them to linger, with the imagery on the screens, with the music, with bars and restaurants, such that they can be exposed to more selling. “If you spend an extra 30 seconds in my area I can serve more advertising on you,” he says. The revenues, O’Ferrall also explains, will help fund the less profitable music businesses on the other side of the block. The architecture, by the long-established practice Orms, who previously made the offices of Camden council into the stylish Standard hotel, is by turns raucous and careful. There is the big, blocky gold-and-black stuff, a bit art deco in inspiration. There are preserved historic facades, gently ornamental affairs of brick and stucco and stone trim. Inside the block there is a version of traditional London backyard construction, a patchwork of glazed bricks and industrial-looking windows. The wider context, outside the site boundary, plays yet more tunes: the zigzag concrete of the 1960s skyscraper Centre Point, a pinkish-and-black flower-patterned building now nearing completion on what was part of Foyle’s bookshop. There’s not much attempt to tie it all together. You get your small-scale Victorian ornament and your domestic Georgian survivals and then you get your full-on blast of the 21st-century high-technology marketing-entertainment complex. This omnivorous eclecticism – an all-you-can-eat buffet of looks and styles and facilities – is the spirit of the whole Outernet endeavour, from the hotel bedrooms to the big screens to the preserved shops. You feel it from the moment you exit the tube station, on the crossroads of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, and are faced with a digital installation that switches from cloudscapes intended to achieve an “immersive experience of mindfulness and relaxation” to something about Unicef to a roar of music from the Clash, a dizzying ride from calm to conscience to Combat Rock. To which one might say: great. Is it not fundamental to a city such as London, and especially Soho and its surroundings, that it’s a place of contrasts, a rich palimpsest of aspiration and creation manifest in its built fabric? And is it not also great that the musical heritage of the neighbourhood has found new and clearly well-funded form? That hundreds of thousands of people will have a good time here, and that artists will get the chance to make and perform music? It’s certainly better that all this is here, and guitar shops kept, than that everything be swept away by a gigantic office block. If it’s brash, then so were the Victorian music halls and 1930s cinemas that are now dearly beloved items of heritage. (And, actually, if you’re going over-the-top, you could have a bit more fun than those black frames offer.) But no one should be under any illusions that this is much like the Tin Pan Alley of old. For what was once multifarious and spontaneous is now under the control of Consolidated Properties and the Outernet. The thing called a “district” is a single-owner real-estate proposition. What would happen to a Bowie now if he tried to kip in his ambulance? Or a Johnny Rotten with a spray can? Or someone who wants to busk in a non-approved way? The project comes with virtuoso PR gobbledegook that deprives sentences of basic sense. The hotel, apparently, “brings together creative expression and fine architectural detail to present something fierce”. Its rooms come with “strong accents of punk rock” and “a rebellious statement piece”. But how “rebellious” can anything on this site be, when it is co-opted to sell cars and software and fashion? The outcome is not Tin Pan Alley, but something akin to how it would look if reconstructed by alien archaeologists, with the help of some wonky artificial intelligence. Maybe this is the way the world is – and modern methods or music production mean that places like Denmark Street can in any case never be what they were – and we should gratefully accept what we are given. But that is not what cities, or music, are really about."
article27,Denmark to hold referendum on scrapping EU defence opt-out,2022-03-06 20:52:53,"['Denmark', 'Europe', 'European Union', 'World news', 'Russia', 'Ukraine']","Denmark’s prime minister has called for the country’s citizens to overturn the country’s opt-out from EU defence policy in a referendum to be held on 1 June, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Historic times call for historic decisions,” Mette Frederiksen told a news conference on Sunday, adding that the government “very clearly calls on Danes to lift the opt-out on defence”. Frederiksen also pledged to increase defence spending by 7bn kroner (£780m) over the next two years. Calling it the “largest investment in recent decades”, Frederiksen set out plans to increase spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033. Participating in the common security and defence policy (CSDP) would enable Denmark to take part in joint EU military operations and to cooperate on the development and acquisition of military capabilities within the EU framework. “For me, as prime minister, this is a values-based decision,” Frederiksen said. “Putin’s pointless and brutal attack on Ukraine has heralded a new era in Europe, a new reality,” she said. “Ukraine’s struggle is not just Ukraine’s; it’s a test of strength for everything we believe in: our values, democracy, human rights, peace and freedom.” To accommodate higher defence spending, Denmark’s current budget restrictions will be eased, and the deficit will turn negative after 2025. Frederiksen also said the main parliamentary parties had agreed that Denmark should become independent of Russian gas “as soon as possible”, although no timeframe was stipulated. “We will also work towards this in the rest of Europe,” she said. The referendum is part of an agreement reached on Sunday with a majority of parties in Denmark’s parliament, the Folketing. The potential turnaround in the Nordic country’s defence policy, in place for 30 years, comes as other European nations also overturn long-held positions on defence and security after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Sweden and Finland, which are not members of Nato, have both seen public support for joining the military alliance reach historically high levels since the start of the war, and this week both governments announced closer partnership with Nato and with each other on defence. Meanwhile, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, overturned decades of defence policy by announcing a €100bn defence spending increase and sending weapons to Ukraine. Denmark’s upcoming referendum will be the ninth that it has held since the 1972 public vote on EU membership. After the public rejected the Maastricht Treaty in June 1992, Copenhagen obtained opt-outs in four sovereign areas: the single currency, justice and police matters, defence and EU citizenship. In December 2015, the Danes voted no to strengthening their cooperation with the European Union on police and security matters for fear of losing their sovereignty over immigration."
article28,Christian Eriksen scores for Denmark on return to Copenhagen’s Parken Stadium,2022-03-29 17:54:22,"['Football', 'Christian Eriksen', 'Denmark', 'Serbia', 'Friendlies', 'Sport']","Christian Eriksen scored a brilliant goal as he made a triumphant return to the Parken Stadium where he almost died of a cardiac arrest last June, netting Denmark’s third in a 3-0 friendly win over Serbia on Tuesday. Eriksen, who scored with his first touch after coming on as a substitute in the 4-2 friendly defeat against the Netherlands in Amsterdam on Saturday, was guaranteed a warm welcome at the stadium that fell into shocked silence when he collapsed in the Euro 2020 group game against Finland. Joakim Maehle gave the Danes the lead with a thumping deflected drive in the 15th minute and Jesper Lindstrøm added a second eight minutes after the break as the home side enjoyed the better chances. Captaining the team, Eriksen gave the vocal Danish crowd what they wanted in the 57th minute, cutting on to his right foot and firing in a fizzing drive at the opposite end of the pitch to where he collapsed. Still building his fitness after restarting his club career at Brentford in February, Eriksen had his name chanted by the crowd as he was replaced in the 80th minute, with Kasper Schmeichel kissing him on the head as he handed over the captain’s armband. Having failed to register a single shot on target until the 88th minute, Serbia will be hoping that they can improve their wayward shooting before both sides head for the World Cup finals in Qatar, which begin in November."

article30,"If you think Denmark is all Borgen and social equality, take a look at its awful ‘ghetto’ law | Hettie O'Brien",2022-06-27 09:00:08,"['Race', 'Housing', 'Denmark', 'Europe', 'Communities', 'Society', 'World news']","We make a habit of idealising Scandinavia. Living in Britain, a country of damp sandwiches, dilapidated housing and extortionate gas bills, makes it easy to fantasise about places like Denmark, with its generous welfare state and 37-hour working week. We laud its social philosophies, binge on its politics as dramatised by TV’s Borgen. The idealised version of this looks like a social democratic utopia in which the state takes care of your worries. It does not look like the experiences of Muhammad Aslam, a taxi driver I spoke to recently while visiting Denmark. Aslam’s story is one that proponents of the Nordic model do not want you to hear. It reveals a darker side to this cosy ideal. And it shows that when the state considers you an outsider, its generous provisions can be swiftly withdrawn and something dystopian can take their place. Aslam has lived on the estate since 1987. For all that time, his home has been Mjølnerparken, a leafy public housing estate of squat red-brick blocks in the centre of Copenhagen (Aslam is the chairman of its residents association). His children were born and grew up here; one has just finished law school, the other is an engineer. From his balcony, Aslam can hear the sound of children playing in the courtyards below, mixed with the chattering voices of their parents and grandparents. Local nurseries use the estate’s green spaces, and every summer, Mjølnerparken hosts a party for teenage residents who have finished school. More than an estate, this is a community. But the government has classified Mjølnerparken as a “ghetto”, and plans to slash its public housing stock to no more than 40% of the total. Last month, Aslam received a letter informing him that he has until September to move out of his home. This all stems from a 2018 law intended to eradicate all ghettoes in Denmark by 2030. And the Danish state decides whether areas are deemed ghettoes not just by their crime, unemployment or education rates, but on the proportion of residents who are deemed “non-western” – meaning recent, first-, or second-generation migrants. Aslam and most others living in Mjølnerparken are Danish citizens but, as they were not born in western countries, they are treated as foreigners in their own homes. Aslam’s children were born in Denmark, attended Danish schools and have Danish university degrees. Because their father was born in Pakistan, they too are deemed “non-western”. This is not a story of gentrification or the hidden hand of the market, pricing people out of city centres. It is worse than that. It is, in effect, state-directed population control. A real estate investor, NREP, has already bought 260 of the flats on the estate. Once people like Aslam have been removed, the company plans to increase the rent on their former homes by more than 50%. Residents will be rehoused, but they will have no control over location or cost. Their children will need to move schools; their communities will be broken up. “What have I and my family done? Why do we have to be removed? My kids and my family have done nothing wrong,” Aslam says. What is playing out on this estate is far from just a local issue. In 2017, the country’s parliament expressed concern that people they considered true Danes were becoming a minority in some areas. The ghetto law was passed the following year. By breaking up these communities, the government hopes to confront what it calls “parallel societies”. This phrase recurs so often in Denmark that it borders on a collective paranoia: the fear that areas that are home to large numbers of minority and Muslim citizens risk splintering a national culture. The ghetto law was the invention of Denmark’s previous rightwing government. Yet it is now being enforced by the left-leaning Social Democrat government, in an attempt to shore up support among voters it worries will otherwise be lost to the right. This matters not just in Denmark but in Britain, too. It is often said that leftwing parties must placate the cultural anxieties of left-behind voters if they are to stave off the electoral threat from the right. This is visible in the distinction drawn between “somewheres” and “anywheres”, the argument that working-class Labour votes collapsed because people feel like “strangers in their own country”, or in the books that give an academic sheen to the troubling idea that the “racial self-interest” of white citizens is not the same thing as racism. Some have even appeared to suggest, much like the Danish government, that whether you’re truly British is defined on the basis of your ethnicity. Denmark’s Social Democrat party has been praised by British commentators as a lesson in how to achieve integration and as a model for neutralising the right. Mjølnerparken shows just how ugly these ideas are in practice. It should be a lesson: travel down this path, and you will find yourself forcefully ripping apart communities in the name of social harmony. Few residents of Mjølnerparken would deny the estate has its problems. Unemployment and crime rates are higher than average, and overcrowding is an issue. Scratch the surface, though, and you’ll find many stories that defy this picture: Ibrahim Kadoura, an electrician who has lived here since 1992, tells me with pride about his son’s place at medical school and his daughter’s senior role at a consultancy firm. The government sees the problems on such estates as the product of migrants failing to integrate, but residents know it’s more complicated. The job market discriminates against people with Middle Eastern and non-Danish surnames, while many people struggle to find jobs simply because they live on a stigmatised estate like Mjølnerparken. Breaking up the estate would destroy a supportive community and do little to address the discrimination its residents face. Conformity is central to Danish culture. Believing that people are similar to you and share your values can be useful in maintaining support for a welfare state. But there is a darker side implicit in this requirement: if the country’s generous welfare state is uniquely Danish, then migrants and outsiders who are not considered truly Danish are easily characterised as a threat to it. “The most important thing, when people live with each other, is tolerance – ‘I will accept you, and you will accept me’,” Kadoura says. “I accept the Danish people. But it feels like they cannot accept me.” Hettie O’Brien is a writer and assistant opinion editor at the Guardian"
article31,Christian Eriksen gets first Denmark call-up since cardiac arrest at Euro 2020,2022-03-15 11:05:52,"['Christian Eriksen', 'Denmark', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Brentford']","Christian Eriksen was called up to the Denmark squad on Tuesday, the first time he has been selected since he suffered a cardiac arrest at the European Championship last year. Kasper Hjulmand included the midfielder in the 23-man squad that will play the Netherlands and Serbia in friendlies this month. The Serbia match will be Eriksen’s first return to Parken, where he collapsed against Finland. “I expect Christian to go in and be a deciding factor for our team,” Hjulmand told the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet. “I did not expect him to play right now, realistically I thought he would be ready by the summer. However Christian is with the squad because he is the best in that position.” Eriksen, 30, signed for Brentford in January as a free agent for the rest of the season after Internazionale terminated his contract because of Serie A rules. Eriksen was fitted with a special heart-starting device known as an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), which is not permitted in Italy’s top flight. Denmark have qualified for the World Cup in Qatar which starts in November. Eriksen said in January that it was “a goal, a dream” to play in the tournament. “Christian is in a really good physical shape,” Hjulmand said. “I saw him against Burnley on Saturday where he was the best player out there. He is a player that thinks faster than most.”"
article32,"Denmark’s Covid mass mink cull had no legal justification, says report",2022-06-30 16:54:05,"['Denmark', 'Coronavirus', 'Farming', 'Europe', 'Environment', 'Science', 'Infectious diseases']","The Danish government lacked legal justification and made “grossly misleading” statements when it ordered a mass mink extermination two years ago, according to an official inquiry into Europe’s first compulsory farm sector shutdown, which has cost taxpayers billions in compensation to farmers. In November 2020, Denmark, the world’s largest mink producer, announced it would kill its entire farmed mink population of 15 million animals, because of fears that a Covid-19 mutation moving from mink to humans could jeopardise future vaccines. The extermination plan was fraught with problems, including reports of mink rising from mass graves, pollution risks from buried carcasses and fears that escaped mink might infect those in the wild and create a permanent virus reservoir from which new variants might infect humans. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, also admitted she had been informed only after the cull started that it was illegal. Although there had been reported outbreaks of Covid in farmed mink in Europe and North America, Denmark was the only country to order a wholesale cull and shutdown of its industry. Denmark’s State Serum Institute (SSI) said earlier this year that the mutated virus that sparked the mink extermination, known as Cluster 5, was now considered extinct. The SSI had warned in November 2020 that in the “worst case scenario, Cluster 5 could cause a second pandemic and Denmark could become the new Wuhan. In addition, vaccines under development might not be effective.” Danish mink farmer Martin Merrild said: “They [the Danish government] panicked. It was a huge shock, as we lost our whole businesses from one day to the next. “It was close to the skinning season, so we could have reduced the population and just kept a small breeding population for the following year, which could then have been vaccinated. But they ignored the normal processes of consulting with industry that we have in Denmark,” he said. The ban on mink farming in Denmark remains in place, with a decision on whether to allow mink breeding to restart due next year. Britta Riis, CEO of Animal Protection Denmark, said despite the inquiry’s findings, a ban was the right decision. She described mink farming as “cruelty to animals, a risk to public health and harmful to the environment”. Given that the Danish taxpayer “has already paid billions … to shut down the industry”, she said the public should “reap the benefits of the ban becoming permanent”. According to the latest government figures, only 15 mink farmers opted to take a compensation package that would allow them to continue fur farming if the ban lifts. Government compensation for the Danish mink sector is expected to cost between £1.8bn and £2.2bn. “I don’t think they even knew how big an industry we had in Denmark. They thought it was a small niche and had no idea the decision would cost taxpayers billions,” said Merrild. The commission’s report found that statements made by the Danish government at a press conference on 4 November 2020, when it announced the cull, were “grossly misleading … given the very far-reaching and intensive nature of the economic and social implications”. The report added that “it was clear that there was no legal basis” to destroy all of Denmark’s mink. The commission also criticised the chief of Denmark’s national police for his role in helping to enforce the cull order when he knew it had no legal basis. Steen Henrik Møller, a senior researcher in the Department of Animal Science at Aarhus University, said the government’s decision was taken “when there was a lot of fear about the Covid pandemic, and it was not clear how the virus was spreading between the mink farms. That was the main worry.” Møller said he could not see the mink sector returning to Denmark even if the ban is lifted. “The mink feed sector is gone, the equipment sector is gone, the breeding stock is gone. It is possible that the 15 farmers that took the compensation that would allow them to restart farming, start again, but it would be very difficult.” Mark Oaten, CEO of the International Fur Federation, said the inquiry’s findings highlighted “serious questions over the handling of the situation in Denmark”. The “whole episode,” he said, “has been awful for the farmers and their animals and nothing will ever be able to put that right.” Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

article33,Netherlands lifts toughest Covid curbs with Denmark and France set to follow,2022-01-26 13:54:55,"['Coronavirus', 'World news', 'Netherlands', 'France', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Sweden']","The Netherlands has lifted its toughest Covid controls, Denmark is to remove all restrictions within days and France will begin easing curbs next week, as many – but not all – EU countries opt to reopen despite record infection numbers. The moves come as data shows hospital and intensive care admissions are not surging in line with cases, and after the World Health Organization suggested the Omicron variant – which studies show is more contagious but usually less severe for vaccinated people – may signal a new, more manageable phase in the pandemic. Dutch bars, restaurants and museums were allowed to reopen on Wednesday after the prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the government was “consciously looking for the limits of what is possible” as case numbers continued to hit new daily highs. Intensive care admissions and deaths, however, have been falling in the Netherlands, and the health minister, Ernst Kuipers, said a decision to prolong restrictive measures would have risked “harming our health and our society”. Cafes, bars and restaurants closed since mid-December can now reopen with reduced capacity and until 10pm as long as customers have a Covid pass, with cinemas, theatres, museums and sports events also allowed to welcome the public back. The Danish government, which two weeks ago allowed cinemas and music venues to reopen after a month’s closure, also announced on Wednesday plans to scrap remaining domestic coronavirus controls from 1 February. The move – which must be approved by parliament – will allow nightclubs to reopen, restaurants to serve alcohol after 10pm, and shops to lift limits on customer numbers. Vaccine passes will no longer be needed, and commuters may travel without wearing masks. Like the Netherlands, Denmark has set successive recent daily infection records. But while coronavirus-related hospitalisations have risen, health authorities say 30%-40% of patients with a positive test are in hospital for reasons other than Covid. “There has been a decoupling in the trend earlier in the epidemic, between increasing infection and increase in Covid hospitalisations,” the government’s expert advisory panel said. The number of Covid patients in intensive care has nearly halved since early January. Belgium last week announced a slight easing of its restrictions from Friday despite record infections, with bars and restaurants allowed to stay open until midnight and indoor activities such as play areas and bowling alleys to reopen. The country’s current Omicron wave is not expected to peak for a fortnight, but hospital admissions are rising at a far slower rate than infections and the number of patients in intensive care is falling. “The situation is manageable,” said the virologist Steven Van Gucht. France on Tuesday reported a new daily record of 501,635 new cases but, again, while hospital admissions have risen, only about half as many patients are in intensive care as during previous waves, and the number has been falling since 12 January. The health minister, Olivier Véran, said the peak of the current coronavirus wave should be reached within the next few days, while the prime minister, Jean Castex, last week announced a timetable for lifting Covid restrictions from 2 February. Castex said France’s vaccine pass, required since Monday to enter restaurants, cinemas and other public venues, would allow audience capacity limits for concert halls and sports and other events to be lifted, with working from home also no longer mandatory for many employees and face masks not needed outside. Some countries, however, are not yet ready to relax restrictions. Sweden’s health minister, Lena Hallengren, on Wednesday extended pandemic curbs by another two weeks because of “an extremely high level of spread”, meaning bars and restaurants must continue to close at 11pm. In Germany, which on Wednesday reported a new 24-hour record of 164,000 infections, MPs are preparing to debate proposals to either require or strongly encourage vaccination. About 74% of the population has received at least one dose, less than in France, Italy or Spain, but the government is divided over a possible vaccine mandate. Options include requiring all adult residents to be vaccinated against Covid, only those above 50, or merely to mandate counselling for unvaccinated people. The WHO’s Europe director, Hans Kluge, said on Sunday it was “plausible” the region was “moving towards a kind of pandemic endgame” and that Omicron could have infected 60% of the continent’s inhabitants by March. Once the current surge is over, immunity through infection or vaccination should last “quite some weeks and months”, Kluge told Agence-France Presse, adding that Covid may come back at the end of the year but not necessarily as a pandemic. He cautioned, however, that it was still too early to consider Covid endemic. “There is a lot of talk about endemic but endemic means it is possible to predict what’s going to happen. This virus has surprised us more than once,” he said, adding that other variants could still emerge."
article34,Denmark and Norway rush in stricter Covid measures as cases soar,2021-12-14 15:45:41,"['Denmark', 'Norway', 'Coronavirus', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Health']","Denmark and Norway have announced stricter Covid measures to battle soaring infection numbers, as authorities said the new Omicron variant was spreading fast and would probably become dominant in several EU countries within weeks or even days. Amid a varied continental picture that includes sharply declining case numbers in many countries, the two Scandinavian governments said they expected daily infections would soon exceed all previous records as the highly transmissible variant combined with and fuelled a wave still largely driven by the previous Delta mutation. Denmark, which like Britain carries out extensive rapid genetic sequencing to detect variants, is second only to the UK in the number of confirmed cases of the mutation, with 3,473 cases identified in a population of 5.8 million of which 80.6% are double jabbed. The Danish government, which last week said schools and colleges would close early, curbed nightlife and promoted remote working, on Tuesday began offering booster shots to all over-40s six weeks earlier than planned in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The national health authority on Monday reported a 50% increase in the number of new weekly cases, the highest since the start of the pandemic, with daily infections hitting 7,799, double the number on the same day last week. While the surge was driven mostly by the Delta variant, it said Omicron was forecast to become dominant in the capital, Copenhagen, from this week, and nationwide soon afterwards. In Norway, authorities said Omicron was “becoming established and will dominate” across the country before Christmas. Norwegian officials have warned Omicron could infect between 90,000 and 300,000 people a day within the next three weeks unless new measures proved effective, compared with a previous peak of about 1,000, while hospital admissions could reach twice their previous level. Norway has registered record numbers of infections and hospital admissions in recent days, among them 958 Omicron cases reported on Monday, including 472 in the capital, Oslo. The prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, warned of a serious situation. A combination of the still-dominant Delta variant and the fast-spreading Omicron would create “a total saturation of the national health system”, Støre said, announcing on Monday evening that booster shots were to be brought forward for health workers and all over-45s. The prime minister also announced that from Wednesday, bars and restaurants would no longer serve alcohol, remote working would be compulsory where possible, mask mandates would be extended and access to pools and gyms restricted. “There is no doubt, the new variant really changes the rules. That’s why we need to act fast and we need to act again,” Støre said. “For many this will feel like a lockdown, if not of society then of their lives and of their livelihoods.” Elsewhere in Europe, infection numbers in countries that endured significant waves last month, before Omicron emerged – including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as central and eastern European nations such as Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Croatia – have fallen sharply. However, officials in France, where there are also signs that the pace of a rapid recent surge may be starting to slow, have warned Omicron will almost certainly fuel a sixth wave, while cases in countries in southern Europe that largely escaped the autumn wave are starting to rise rapidly. Martin Hirsch, the head of Paris’s AP-HP hospitals group, Europe’s largest hospital system, said on Monday France should prepare for an Omicron-driven wave of infections starting in January, while Belgium’s chief epidemiologist said he expected a fresh surge to start “around about new year’s time”. Despite steadily falling case numbers, the Dutch government was expected on Tuesday to announce schools would close a week early for Christmas as infections remained high and hospitals struggled with a wave of patients. Restaurants, bars, non-essential stores and other public places have been closed from 5pm to 5am in the Netherlands since late November in an attempt to slow the virus’s spread. Experts have said Denmark’s advanced sequencing capacity – the country has developed a quick genetic test for Omicron, and is screening every positive test for the variant – provides a uniquely comprehensive picture of how the variant is spreading, and should serve as a warning of what is to come elsewhere in Europe. Researchers at the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen estimated in a report this week that Omicron cases in Denmark were doubling every two days, with about three-quarters of infections reported in people who have received two vaccine doses. They predicted the variant would push daily infections to more than 10,000 by the end of this week, with numbers rising further and hospitals coming under pressure even if, as most scientists believe, Omicron is less virulent than earlier variants – but said their modelling did not account for the impact of booster shots. • This article was amended on 15 December 2021 to clarify that early school closures were announced in Denmark last week; they did not happen then."

We will be launching another live Covid blog a little later today but in the meantime you can catch up with all the latest developments here. Thanks for following along and, as always, I appreciate your tips and reader insights. You can email me at samantha.lock@theguardian.com or via Twitter @Samantha__Lock If you’ve just joined us here on the Covid blog, here is a wrap of all the latest international developments: Europe: Italy will ease Covid restrictions for all visitors from European Union countries starting from 1 February, its health ministry said on Wednesday. Moderna has started testing an Omicron-specific Covid booster in healthy adults. In Denmark, the government announced it will scrap most pandemic restrictions next week, even as neighbouring Sweden extended its own measures for another fortnight. Police in Berlin have been authorised to crack down on protesters wearing badges resembling yellow star badges and other symbols associated with the Nazi era at demonstrations against vaccine mandates or other pandemic restrictions. Story here. The UK has reported a further 102,292 Covid infections and 346 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest data from the government’s coronavirus dashboard. That compares with 94,326 cases and 439 fatalities in the 24 hours prior. Sweden will extend its current pandemic measures by another two weeks, the minister for health said on Wednesday, as Omicron is spreading at record speed. The curbs mean bars and restaurants have to close at 11pm and there is a cap of 500 people inside larger indoor venues. As pressure on hospitals eases, Austria will end its lockdown for people not fully vaccinated against the coronavirus on Monday, though some restrictions on public life will remain. Middle East: Israel has broadened its eligibility for a fourth dose of the Covid vaccine to include adults under 60 with underlying medical conditions, their carers and others over 18 at significant risk of exposure to coronavirus. United States: The United States has donated more than 400m vaccine doses to 112 countries, marking a major milestone in the White House’s goal of donating 1.2bn vaccine doses under president Joe Biden’s direction. The Americas have seen their highest daily Covid caseloads since the pandemic began, and Omicron has clearly become the predominant variant, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said. Over in Kansas, US, a doctor-lawmaker who prescribed a parasitic worm treatment for Covid-19 symptoms has acknowledged that he is under investigation by the state medical board. Conservative Republican state Senator Mark Steffen disclosed the Kansas Board of Healing Arts’ investigation of him during a Senate committee hearing. He was testifying in favour of a bill that would require pharmacists to fill prescriptions for both the anti-worm treatment ivermectin and the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for potentially dangerous off-label uses in treating Covid-19, the Associated Press reports. During the committee’s two days of hearings, several Kansas doctors reported having trouble getting ivermectin prescriptions filled by pharmacists. Committee Chair Richard Hilderband, a conservative Republican from southeast Kansas, said he expects the bill to win the panel’s approval after it is debated next week. “That is something between a doctor and a patient, on what their best way forward on care is,” Hilderbrand said. While medical groups and health experts have worked to stamp out the use of ivermectin for treating Covid-19, hospitals around the nation have faced lawsuits over their refusal to give it to patients. Ivermectin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat infections of lice, roundworms and other tiny parasites in humans. The FDA has tried to debunk claims that animal-strength versions of the drug can help fight Covid-19, warning that large doses can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, seizures, delirium and even death. Speaking of Australia and the surrounding Pacific area, Australian and British and navy ships arrived in Tonga on Wednesday and attempted to deliver contactless aid ashore to avoid spreading Covid in a nation which has so far never had an outbreak. Nearly two dozen sailors aboard the Australian ship HMAS Adelaide were reported to be infected on Tuesday, raising fears they could bring the coronavirus to the small Pacific archipelago devastated by an undersea volcanic eruption and a tsunami on 15 January. Since the pandemic began, Tonga has reported just a single case of Covid-19. It’s one of the few countries in the world currently completely virus free. About 61% of Tongans are fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data. Meanwhile, the US announced it would provide an additional $2.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Tonga through the US Agency for International Development. The aid was in addition to an initial pledge of $100,000. The Australian government said its ship had completed the 3,300-km (2,050-mile) voyage from Brisbane and would deliver supplies without contact with the local population to avoid infections. “We appreciate the decision of the government of Tonga to enable HMAS Adelaide to dock and offload the humanitarian and medical supplies, and the high priority it has placed on Covid safety throughout the recovery process,” the statement said. “The ship is undertaking an entirely contactless delivery of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief supplies.” Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as my colleague Tom Ambrose calls it a night in London. I’ll be bringing you all the international headlines from over here in Sydney, Australia. Let’s start with a quick look at how Covid is unfolding Down Under. Australia’s most populous state of NSW has recorded 29 deaths and 17,316 cases while Victoria recorded 15 Covid deaths and 13,755 cases. Moderna has started testing an Omicron-specific Covid booster in healthy adults. The company announced on Wednesday that the first participant had received a dose. Earlier this week, competitor Pfizer began a similar study of its own reformulated shots. The Associated Press reported: It’s not clear whether global health authorities will order a change to the vaccine recipe in the wake of the hugely contagious omicron variant. The original vaccines still offer good protection against death and severe illness. Studies in the US and elsewhere show a booster dose strengthens that protection and improves the chances of avoiding even a milder infection. Moderna pointed to a small study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday that showed antibodies able to target omicron persisted for six months after a booster dose, although the levels were dropping. Moderna’s new study will enrol about 600 people who already have received either two doses of the company’s original shots or two plus a booster dose. All the volunteers will receive a dose of the experimental omicron-matched version. Brazil has reported 224,567 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, breaking the country’s previous record for daily infections, according to data released by the health ministry. The South American country also reported 570 deaths from Covid. The previous record for daily cases was 204,854 on January 19. Brazil has now registered a total of 24,535,884 cases and 624,413 deaths. Italy will ease Covid restrictions for all visitors from European Union countries starting from 1 February, its health ministry said on Wednesday. Minister of health Roberto Speranza has signed an order stating that travellers from EU countries will only need a “green pass,” it said in statement. The Green Pass, is a document showing proof of Covid immunity through vaccination, previous infection or a negative test. On 14 December, Italy had ruled that all EU visitors had to take a test before departure, amid concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. According to the ministry, Speranza’s order also renews the go-ahead for travel to a number of non-European tourist spots, widening it to six other destinations: Cuba, Singapore, Turkey, Thailand (limited to the island of Phuket), Oman and French Polynesia. In September 2021, Italy had set up these so-called Covid-free tourist corridors: Maldives, Seychelles, Mauritius, Egypt (but only Sharm El Sheikh and Marsa Alam), Dominican Republic and Aruba. Israel has broadened its eligibility for a fourth dose of the Covid vaccine to include adults under 60 with underlying medical conditions, their carers and others over 18 at significant risk of exposure to coronavirus. An official statement said the health ministry’s director-general had approved the measures. Earlier this month, as the Omicron variant swept the country, Israel began offering a fourth dose, meaning a second booster, of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to people over 60. The United States has donated more than 400m vaccine doses to 112 countries, marking a major milestone in the White House’s goal of donating 1.2bn vaccine doses under president Joe Biden’s direction. In a press briefing on Wednesday, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients, said the donation is four times larger than that of any other country. Zients also revealed that the country hit another major milestone this week, with 70% of eligible seniors in the US having now received their booster shot. Half of all eligible adults in the country are now boosted. “This is significant progress, as the doctors and data have made crystal clear. Vaccinations and boosters provide the best protection,” Zients said. The daily averages of cases and hospital admissions have fallen over the past week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The current seven-day daily average of Covid-19 cases is approximately 692,400 cases per day, a 6% decrease from the previous week, while the seven-day average of hospital admissions is around 19,800 per day, an 8% decrease. Also in Denmark, the government announced today that it will scrap most pandemic restrictions next week, even as neighbouring Sweden extended its own measures for another fortnight. Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen said that as of 1 February, Danes will enjoy free access to restaurants, cafes, museums and nightclubs, while mask use will cease to be mandatory. “We say goodbye to the restrictions and welcome the life we knew before” the pandemic, Frederiksen said. “As of 1 February, Denmark will be open.” Denmark currently requires face masks on public transportation, in shops, for standing clients in restaurant indoor areas, and for people entering hospitals, health care facilities and retirement homes. As of 1 February, the government will only recommend mask use in hospitals, health care facilities and homes for the elderly. Frederiksen said that while the Omicron variant is surging in Denmark, it is not placing a heavy burden on the health system and the country has a high vaccination rate. “It may seem strange that we want to remove restrictions given the high infection rates,” she said. “But fewer people become seriously ill.” Hello. Tom Ambrose here, taking over the global Covid live blog for the next couple of hours. I’ll be bringing you all the latest coronavirus news as it happens. Let’s start with the news that the BA.2 subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant appears more contagious than the more common BA.1 sub-lineage, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke has said. “There is no evidence that the BA.2 variant causes more disease, but it must be more contagious,” Heunicke told a news conference today. The BA.1 lineage currently accounts for 98% of all cases globally but in Denmark has been pushed aside by BA.2, which became the dominant strain in the second week of January. The UK Health Security Agency has designated BA.2 a variant under investigation, saying it could have a growth advantage. Preliminary calculations suggest BA.2 could be 1.5 times more infectious than BA.1, Denmark’s top infectious disease authority, Statens Serum Institut (SSI), said in a note on Wednesday. However, an initial analysis by the institute showed no difference in the risk of hospitalisation for BA.2 compared to BA.1. Here is a quick recap of some of the main developments from today so far: Police in Berlin have been authorised to crack down on protesters wearing badges resembling yellow star badges and other symbols associated with the Nazi era at demonstrations against vaccine mandates or other pandemic restrictions. Story here. The Americas have seen their highest daily Covid caseloads since the pandemic began, and Omicron has clearly become the predominant variant, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said. There were more than 8 million new cases, 32% higher than the previous week, while fatalities throughout the region increased by 37%, with 18,000 new deaths caused by Covid. The US continues to have the highest number of new infections, although cases decreased by nearly one million over the last week, the regional health agency said on Wednesday. Mexico’s southern states have seen new infections triple and Brazil has seen new cases surge 193% over the last seven days, PAHO said. The UK has reported a further 102,292 Covid infections and 346 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest data from the government’s coronavirus dashboard. That compares with 94,326 cases and 439 fatalities in the 24 hours prior. Lower vaccination take-up among some ethnic groups in England contributes to an increased risk of Covid-19 death, particularly for people from black African and Caribbean backgrounds, new ONS research suggests. [see 1.08pm]. Sweden will extend its current pandemic measures by another two weeks, the minister for health said on Wednesday, as Omicron is spreading at record speed. The curbs mean bars and restaurants have to close at 11pm and there is a cap of 500 people inside larger indoor venues. “We have an extremely high level of spread,” the health minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. “The restrictions must remain in place for two weeks. If everything goes as planned and if the situation allows, the restrictions will be lifted after that.” [see 12.20pm]. In the UK, adults aged 18 to 69 who had received their first two vaccines appeared to be 41.1% less likely to report experiencing long Covid symptoms if they contracted the virus, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. Story here. The lower house of the German parliament began debating proposals to either require or robustly encourage residents to be vaccinated, as a new daily record of 164,000 Covid cases was reported. [see 11.36am]. As pressure on hospitals eases, Austria will end its lockdown for people not fully vaccinated against the coronavirus on Monday, though some restrictions on public life will remain. Since 15 November, those not vaccinated against the coronavirus have been under lockdown restrictions, meaning they are only allowed to leave their homes for a limited number of reasons such as shopping for essentials or working. The measure, which was suspended over Christmas, has been criticised as very difficult to enforce. However, while that restriction on their movement will be lifted, the unvaccinated will remain barred from taking part in a range of leisure activities including eating in restaurants or shopping for non-essential items. [see 11.19am]. German police have been told to detain Covid protesters trivialising the Holocaust in acts to be classified as “secondary antisemitism”, our Berlin bureau chief Philip Oltermann reports. Police in Berlin have been authorised to crack down on protesters wearing badges resembling the yellow Judenstern (Jews’ star) and other symbols associated with the Nazi era at demonstrations against vaccine mandates or other pandemic restrictions. According to an internal update by the Berlin police antisemitism commissioner, first reported by the newspaper BZ Berlin, “the use of adapted ‘Jewish stars’ at gatherings can now be assumed to be a fundamental disturbance of public peace”. Police in the German capital have been instructed to document, remove and confiscate the yellow star badges, which some German vaccine sceptics have taken to wearing with the superimposed words “ungeimpft” (“unvaccinated”) in order to draw a parallel between modern governments’ treatment of those who decline to take a jab against Covid-19 and the systematic stigmatisation of Jewish citizens in the Nazi era. The police’s internal memo clarifies that wearing the blue and white Star of David, classified as a purely religious symbol, remains legal at demonstrations. In addition, police are also instructed to take action against other analogies that trivialise the Holocaust, which are to be classified as forms of “secondary antisemitism”. Read the full story here: Germany to crack down on Covid protesters in yellow star badges A quick snap from Reuters. The Americas have seen their highest daily Covid caseloads since the pandemic began, and Omicron has clearly become the predominant variant, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said. There were more than 8 million new cases, 32% higher than the previous week, while fatalities throughout the region increased by 37%, with 18,000 new deaths caused by Covid. The United States continues to have the highest number of new infections, although cases decreased by nearly one million over the last week, the regional health agency said on Wednesday. Mexico’s southern states have seen new infections triple and Brazil has seen new cases surge 193% over the last seven days, PAHO said. Children in the Americas are facing the worst educational crisis ever seen in the region, with millions of children yet to return to classes, according to PAHO, which recommended that countries try to get them safely back to school to protect their social, mental and physical wellbeing. It urged parents to get their children vaccinated. Many countries have already authorised and are safely administering Covid vaccines to adolescents, PAHO said. Last week the WHO’s expert group on immunisation authorised the Covid vaccine developed by Pfizer for children aged five to 12, offering a roadmap for countries to roll out vaccines for them, the regional agency said. The UK has reported a further 102,292 Covid infections and 346 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest data from the government’s coronavirus dashboard. That compares with 94,326 cases and 439 fatalities in the 24 hours prior. Plastic PPE waste is to be given a second life as fresh PPE products or fuels as part of a new UK research project, PA reports. Since the start of the pandemic, 8.4 million tonnes of plastic PPE waste, including respirators and masks, have been generated from 193 countries, and the majority has been dumped in landfill. Now a partnership between Heriot-Watt University and PPE maker Globus Group will recycle some of the rubbish in a world-first collaboration. Dr Aimaro Sanna, an assistant professor in chemical and process engineering at the Edinburgh university, said: As the world strives to reduce its landfill, ocean impact and carbon emissions, this project is a significant step towards addressing the increased waste generated during the global pandemic. At the moment much of the plastic PPE waste cannot be recycled mechanically, but the project between the university and the manufacturer will turn used plastic protective equipment into pyrolysis oil, which can then be refined into new commercial products like new PPE products or fuels. The project will run for two years. Sanna said: Initially, the research will help to recycle over 100 tonnes of product generated by the manufacturing process every year – the equivalent to 10kg of waste every hour. However, our hope is that this new process will be adopted more widely. Many countries have been unable to process their plastic waste PPE properly. Our groundbreaking research aims to address these challenges providing an exemplar technique for application globally. Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, Globus Group has been producing 1bn masks for healthcare trusts across the UK, but the manufacturing process results in 7g of waste material per mask. It is hoped the project will develop a process for cost and energy efficient recycling and repurposing of the PPE waste. As part of the scheme to cut down on PPE waste, Globus Group has implemented thermal heating technology at its Alpha Solway factory in Golborne, near Manchester. The machine heats and compacts the plastic polypropylene into large, reusable blocks. They are then collected and processed, providing raw materials to create new PPE products and reducing its waste by around 85%. Pete Lee, the head of quality at the company, said the machine “is a fundamental part of our process to repurpose and utilise waste material to achieve a circular economy” and said the technology “will be a real gamechanger in the way we tackle our PPE waste”. Many EU countries are opting to reopen despite record infections as the World Health Organization suggests Omicron may signal a more manageable phase of pandemic, our Europe correspondent Jon Henley reports. The Netherlands has lifted its toughest Covid controls, Denmark is set to remove all restrictions within days and France will begin easing curbs next week, as many – but not all – EU countries move to reopen despite record infection numbers. The moves come as data shows hospital and intensive care admissions are not surging in line with cases, and after the World Health Organization suggested the Omicron variant – which studies show is more contagious but usually less severe for vaccinated people – may signal a new, more manageable phase in the pandemic. Dutch bars, restaurants and museums were allowed to reopen on Wednesday after the prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the government was “consciously looking for the limits of what is possible” as case numbers continue to hit new daily highs. Intensive care admissions and deaths, however, have been falling in the Netherlands, and the health minister, Ernst Kuipers, said a decision to prolong restrictive measures would have risked “harming our health and our society”. Cafes, bars and restaurants closed since mid-December can now reopen with reduced capacity and until 10pm as long as customers have a Covid pass, with cinemas, theatres, museums and sports events also allowed to welcome the public back. The Danish government, which two weeks ago allowed cinemas and music venues to reopen after a month’s closure, also announced on Wednesday plans to scrap remaining domestic coronavirus controls from 1 February. The move – which must be approved by parliament – will allow nightclubs to reopen, restaurants to serve alcohol after 10pm, and shops to lift limits on customer numbers. Vaccine passes will no longer be needed, and commuters may travel without wearing masks. Like the Netherlands, Denmark has set successive recent daily infection records But while coronavirus-related hospitalisations have risen, health authorities say between 30%-40% of patients with a positive test are in hospital for other reasons than Covid. “There has been a decoupling in the trend earlier in the epidemic, between increasing infection and increase in Covid hospitalisations,” the government’s expert advisory panel said. The number of Covid patients in intensive care has nearly halved since early January. Belgium last week announced a slight easing of its restrictions from Friday despite record infections, with bars and restaurants allowed to stay open until midnight and indoor activities such as play areas and bowling alleys to reopen. The country’s current Omicron wave is not expected to peak for a fortnight, but hospital admissions are rising at a far slower rate than infections and the number of patients in intensive care is falling. “The situation is manageable,” said Steven Van Gucht, a virologist. France on Tuesday reported a new daily record of 501,635 new cases, but again, while hospital admissions have risen, only about half as many patients are in intensive care as during previous waves, and the number has been falling since 12 January. The health minister, Olivier Véran, said the peak of the current coronavirus wave should be reached within the next few days, while the prime minister, Jean Castex, last week announced a timetable for lifting Covid restrictions from 2 February. Castex said France’s vaccine pass, required since Monday to enter restaurants, cinemas and other public venues, would allow audience capacity limits for concert halls and sports and other events to be lifted, with working from home also no longer mandatory for many employees and face masks not needed outside. The full story is here: Netherlands lifts toughest Covid curbs with Denmark and France set to follow This report is from the PA news agency. Lower vaccination take-up among some ethnic groups in England contributes to an increased risk of Covid-19 death, particularly for people from black African and Caribbean backgrounds, new research suggests. Most ethnic minority groups have continued to experience greater rates of death involving Covid during the third wave of the virus compared with people identifying as white British. These differences have been attributed mostly to social and demographic factors, including geography, type of residence and health. But levels of vaccination coverage are now contributing to the elevated risk of death observed in some groups, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It is the first time vaccination take-up has been linked in this way with estimates of mortality rates. Between 13 June and 1 December 2021, the risk of death involving Covid for black African males in England was 1.4 times greater than that for white British males, after adjusting for age, demographic factors and certain pre-existing conditions. But after also adjusting for vaccination status - to reflect if someone has received a first, second or third dose – this difference was found to have been eliminated. A similar pattern was evident for black Caribbean males, with the risk 1.7 times greater before adjusting for vaccination status, but no excess risk after. For black African and Caribbean females, the risk of Covid death before adjusting for vaccination was estimated at 1.8 and 2.1 times greater than white British females respectively – but again, this excess risk disappeared after accounting for vaccine take-up. The figures suggest that, once adjusted for vaccination status, there is no evidence that the risk of death involving Covid-19 is greater for people from these ethnic groups than for the white British ethnic group, the ONS said. People identifying as black African and Caribbean have the lowest vaccination rates among people over the age of 50, however. Differences in vaccination coverage between these two groups and the white British group “explain a large part of the excess risk”, the ONS added. Overall the ONS found that, during the third wave of the virus, the fully adjusted risk of Covid-19 mortality – including vaccination status – is similar to the white British group for all ethnic groups, except the Bangladeshi group (2.2 times greater for males and 2.1 times greater for females) and for Pakistani men (1.2 times greater). Vahe Nafilyan, senior statistician in the ONS health and life events division, said: Today’s analysis shows that since the vaccination programme began, the risk of death from Covid-19 has continued to be higher in most ethnic minority groups than in the white British ethnic group. As already highlighted in our analyses of earlier periods, these differences in mortality are largely explained by socio-demographic and economic factors and health. For the first time, we show that the lower vaccination coverage in some ethnic groups also contributes to the elevated risk of Covid-19 death, particularly in the black African and black Caribbean groups. A further 145 deaths from Covid were registered by National Records of Scotland, the official statistics agency, over last week, as the country saw a fresh peak of fatalities linked to the pandemic. NRS said the 145 deaths recorded in the seven days to Sunday 23 January – including where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate as a suspected or probable factor – was 10 higher than the previous week. That brings Scotland’s total under that measure to 12,283 fatalities. These fatalities, while lower than the last peak of 167 weekly deaths during the Delta wave in September, and well below the 663 recorded in April 2020, are continuing to rise while the overall number of Omicron cases in Scotland have fallen. This is due to a lag between initial infections leading to hospitalisations and deaths, which now run at a much lower ratio due to the vaccinations programme, much more successful hospital treatments and the lower lethality of the Omicron variant. Related: Scotland to relax strict work-from-home guidance from Monday Sweden will extend its current pandemic measures by another two weeks, the minister for health said on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant is spreading at record speed. The curbs mean bars and restaurants have to close at 11pm and there is a cap of 500 people inside larger indoor venues. “We have an extremely high level of spread,” the health minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. “The restrictions must remain in place for two weeks. If everything goes as planned and if the situation allows, the restrictions will be lifted after that.” Sweden has seen some 270,000 confirmed cases in the last seven days but limited testing means the health agency believes the real number could be over half a million. The spread of the virus has put strain on the healthcare system but much less than during previous waves. The number of patients treated in intensive care have been between 90 and 120 people for the past four weeks. Sweden stood out early in the pandemic by opting against lockdowns, instead relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene. It has seen deaths per capita much higher than Nordic neighbours but lower than most European countries that opted for lockdowns. In the UK, adults aged 18 to 69 who had received their first two vaccines appeared to be 41.1% less likely to report experiencing long Covid symptoms if they contracted the virus, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. This figure is based on data up to 30 November 2021 and a comparison with people in the same range who were unvaccinated, the ONS said. “Longer follow-up time is needed to assess the impact of booster doses and the Omicron variant,” the ONS added. The lower house of the German parliament prepared to debate proposals to either require or robustly encourage residents to be vaccinated on Wednesday, as a new daily record of 164,000 Covid cases was reported, Reuters reports. Around 75% of the population have received at least one dose of a vaccine – less than in western European peers such as France, Italy or Spain, where the equivalent figures are 80%, 83% and 86% – and the vaccination campaign is stuttering. The proposals being debated include requiring all adult residents to be vaccinated against Covid, or only those over the age of 50, or merely requiring all those who have not been vaccinated to receive counselling. Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, Germany was more successful than many of its peers in limiting infections through case tracking, strict lockdowns and quarantines. But public discontent has been growing, with regular protests by those opposed to ongoing restrictions that exclude the unvaccinated from many indoor activities. The highly contagious Omicron variant has sent cases soaring in recent weeks. The 166 deaths recorded on Wednesday took Germany’s cumulative toll to 117,126. The German Hospital Federation chairman, Gerald Gass, said the number of patients in normal hospital wards with Covid had increased significantly. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, the number rose by 37% in a week. “This development will affect all federal states shortly,” Gass told Reuters, adding that he was in favour of compulsory vaccination while the end of the pandemic was not in sight. Protests were expected in front of the Reichstag parliament building before and during the debate, with around 1,600 police officers due to be deployed to the area, the broadcaster RBB reported, citing Berlin police. Opponents of compulsory vaccination say it violates the second article of the constitution, which guarantees citizens control over their own bodies. According to an Allensbach survey published on Wednesday by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, the share of those who could imagine themselves taking part in protests against anti-Covid measures had doubled to 12% in the space of a year. As pressure on hospitals eases, Austria will end its lockdown for people not fully vaccinated against the coronavirus on Monday, though some restrictions on public life will remain, Reuters reports. New daily Covid infections are rising, driven by the Omicron variant, and hit a new record above 30,000 on Wednesday, the health minister Wolfgang Mückstein told a news conference. He added that they would peak in the next two weeks at around 35,000 to 40,000. The occupancy rate of hospital and intensive-care beds, however, has been falling, Mückstein said, leading experts to view the lockdown for the unvaccinated as no longer necessary: We came to the conclusion that the lockdown for unvaccinated people in Austria is only justifiable in the event of the threat of an imminent over-burdening of intensive-care capacity. Since 15 November, those not vaccinated against the coronavirus have been under lockdown restrictions, meaning they are only allowed to leave their homes for a limited number of reasons such as shopping for essentials or working. The measure, which was suspended over Christmas, has been criticised as very difficult to enforce. However, while that restriction on their movement will be lifted, the unvaccinated will remain barred from taking part in a range of leisure activities including eating in restaurants or shopping for non-essential items. Those measures will continue to form part of government efforts to increase the vaccination rate, which is among the lowest in western Europe. Good morning from London. I’m Lucy Campbell, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Two-thirds of people recently infected with the Omicron variant say they had Covid previously, according to a new British study. Almost two out of every three Covid-positive participants reported having had Covid before, according to the findings published by the Imperial College London. “Among the 3,582 swab-positive individuals reporting whether or not they had had previous infection, 2,315 (64.6%) reported a confirmed previous infection,” the report read. The prevalence of Covid in the UK has fallen overall in recent weeks, but has risen in school-age children, say researchers who have warned the uptick could pose a risk to adults. The latest data from the React-1 study, which is based on more than 100,000 swabs from randomly selected individuals in England collected between 5 and 20 January this year, shows that the overall weighted prevalence of Covid was 4.41% Around nine in 10 young teenagers in the UK are likely to have Covid-19 antibodies, new analysis by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) suggests. The ONS figures are based on a sample of blood test results. The self-isolation period in Wales is to be cut to a minimum of five full days, the Welsh government has said. The new rules come in to force from Friday 28 January, and mean people will be able to end their isolation as long as they have two negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Denmark aims to scrap all remaining Covid-19 restrictions next week, the most far-reaching easing of curbs yet seen among the Nordic countries. A wave of Covid record setting is going across central and Eastern Europe. Among countries setting new daily records for cases today are Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Russia and Romania. Russia has cut the isolation time for Covid contacts from 14 days to seven. Germany’s lower house of parliament is discussing the proposal to make vaccination mandatory later today. Options before lawmakers include requiring all adult residents to be vaccinated against Covid, or only those above 50, or merely requiring all those who have not been vaccinated to receive counselling. The Australian navy’s largest ship has docked at disaster-stricken Tonga and was allowed to unload humanitarian supplies in the South Pacific nation – despite crew members being infected with Covid-19, officials have said. South Korea’s daily new coronavirus cases has exceeded 13,000 for the first time, according to data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The US Department of Labor said it will withdraw its Covid-19 vaccine-and-testing requirement for large employers after the supreme court blocked the rule. It is a very lively day in British politics, as Downing Street awaits the delivery of Sue Gray’s report on No 10’s alleged lockdown parties. Andrew Sparrow is, of course, following that keenly for us. Lucy Campbell will be here shortly to continue this live blog, with all the latest coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. I will see you again tomorrow. Around nine in 10 young teenagers in the UK are likely to have Covid-19 antibodies, new analysis by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) suggests. The estimates, which are for children aged 12 to 15, range from 88% in Wales to 91.7% in Scotland, with 90.9% in England and 90.7% in Northern Ireland. It is the first time figures have been published for this age group. Ian Jones reports for PA Media that the presence of coronavirus antibodies suggests someone has had the infection in the past or has been vaccinated. It takes between two and three weeks after infection or vaccination for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the virus. The ONS figures are based on a sample of blood test results for the week beginning 3 January 2022. The very high level of antibodies among young teenagers reflects both the prevalence of coronavirus in this age group in recent months and also the impact of the vaccination programme. First doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been available for 12 to 15-year-olds since September 2021. The ONS said said there is a “clear pattern” between vaccination and testing positive for Covid-19 antibodies but “the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination”. I mentioned earlier that Poland’s deputy health minister Waldemar Kraska had warned that the country would set a new daily cases record today [see 9.22am]. Reuters now have the official figure – 53,420. It means Poland joins Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Russia and Romania in hitting its highest infection rate of the pandemic. “We have to be ready for a further rise in cases, even above 60,000,” a health ministry spokesperson told a news conference. In an attempt to combat the surge, Poland has stepped up testing, performing a record 173,000 official tests in 24 hours. It has also said older primary and secondary schoolchildren must switch to remote learning from Thursday. The Australian navy’s largest ship has docked at disaster-stricken Tonga and was allowed to unload humanitarian supplies in the South Pacific nation – despite crew members being infected with Covid-19, officials have said. Associated Press report that nearly two dozen sailors aboard the HMAS Adelaide were reported infected yesterday, raising fears the mercy mission could bring the coronavirus to the small archipelago devastated by the recent undersea volcanic eruption and subsequent tsunami on 15 January. Since the pandemic began, Tonga has reported just a single case of Covid-19 and has avoided any outbreaks. The Australian government said in a statement: We appreciate the decision of the government of Tonga to enable HMAS Adelaide to dock and offload the humanitarian and medical supplies, and the high priority it has placed on Covid safety throughout the recovery process. The ship is undertaking an entirely contactless delivery of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief supplies. Denmark aims to scrap all remaining Covid-19 restrictions next week, the most far-reaching easing of curbs yet seen among the Nordic countries. In a letter addressed to parliament, Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said the government intends to follow recommendations issued by an expert panel on Tuesday to scrap all restrictions. Reuters note that the proposal is still subject to parliamentary approval. Poland is another country setting Covid records. Deputy health minister Waldemar Kraska said it will report a record number of new Covid-19 cases today, with the daily count rising above 50,000 and expected to climb in coming days, Kraska told website interia.pl that the highly transmissible Omicron variant currently accounted for around 40% of cases. “The fifth wave is gaining momentum. Today we will have over 50,000 new SARS-CoV-2 infections,” Kraska said. “This is a record number, and in the coming days there will be further increases in infections, which we can see from the number of referrals for PCR tests (...) and in the number of tests performed.” Germany today reported a new record of 164,000 Covid-19 infections in one day, as the lower house of parliament prepared to debate proposals to either require or robustly encourage residents to be vaccinated. Around 75% of the population has received at least one dose of a vaccine – less than in other western European countries such as France, Italy or Spain, where the equivalent figures are all over 80% – and the vaccination campaign is stuttering. Reuters report that the proposals being debated include requiring all adult residents to be vaccinated against Covid, or only those above 50, or merely requiring all those who have not been vaccinated to receive counselling. Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, Germany was more successful than many of its peers in limiting infections through case tracking and quarantines. But since last summer, vaccine-scepticism and a falloff in regional coordination have taken their toll, and public discontent has grown. Opponents of compulsory vaccination say it violates the second article of the constitution, which guarantees citizens control over their own bodies. Russia reported a record daily number of Covid-19 today, for the sixth consecutive day. Reuters report that new daily cases jumped to 74,692, up from from 67,809 a day earlier. The government coronavirus task force also reported 657 official deaths from coronavirus in the last 24 hours. Speaking of airlines, if you missed it, we had this report from Arthur Neslen earlier: At least 100,000 “ghost flights” could be flown across Europe this winter because of EU airport slot usage rules, according to analysis by Greenpeace. The deserted, unnecessary or unprofitable flights are intended to allow airlines to keep their takeoff and landing runway rights in major airports, but they could also generate up to 2.1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions – or as much as 1.4 million average petrol or diesel cars emit in a year – Greenpeace says. “The EU Commission requiring airlines to fly empty planes to meet an arbitrary quota is not only polluting, but extremely hypocritical given their climate rhetoric,” said Herwig Schuster, a spokesperson for Greenpeace’s European Mobility for All campaign. “Transport emissions are skyrocketing,” he said. “It would be irresponsible of the EU to not take the low-hanging fruit of ending ghost flights and banning short-haul flights where there’s a reasonable train connection.” When the Covid pandemic began, the European Commission cut the benchmark for flight operations that airlines must meet to keep their slots open from 80% to 25%. But last December, Brussels upped the benchmark to 50%, rising again to 64% in March. Read more of Arthur Neslen’s report here: Airlines flying near-empty ‘ghost flights’ to retain EU airport slots More passengers took Wizz Air flights over the Christmas period despite the rise of the Omicron variant, and the carrier said it was cautiously optimistic about the continued recovery of air travel during the spring. The budget airline reported it carried 7.8 million passengers during the three months to the end of December, even more than it did in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, while its planes were more than three-quarters (77%) full. Read more of Joanna Partridge’s report here: Wizz Air passenger numbers rise to 7.8m despite Omicron fears The self-isolation period in Wales is to be cut to a minimum of five full days, the Welsh Government has said. The new rules mean people will be able to end their isolation as long as they have two negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Health minister Eluned Morgan confirmed the changes would come into force from Friday 28 January, the same day the country is expected to complete the move to alert level zero. PA Media note that it will bring the nation in line with the measures in place in England and Northern Ireland. Morgan said: “After carefully reviewing all the available evidence, we believe that testing on days five and six together with five full days of isolation will have the same protective effect as a 10-day isolation period. “But it is really important everyone self-isolates and uses lateral flow tests in the way advised to ensure they protect others from the risk of infection.” The minister said that while isolation was important to prevent transmission of the virus, long periods of isolation could “have a negative impact on our mental health and can be damaging for our public services and the wider economy”. Those who test positive on either day five or day six will still have to continue to self-isolate until they have two negative tests taken 24 hours apart or until day 10, whichever comes first. Thousands of people gathered in New Delhi early this morning to watch a display of the India’s military power amid the annual Republic Day spectacle – however the event was curtailed due to Covid-19. Associated Press report that nearly 500 schoolchildren, folk dancers, police and military battalions, floats and stunt performers on motorbikes paraded from the presidential palace down the refurbished tree-lined boulevard of Rajpath. President Ram Nath Kovind received salutes from the marching columns, which included a camel-mounted regiment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, government ministers and foreign diplomats attended. Republic Day marks the anniversary of the adoption of the country’s constitution on 26 January 1950. Because of the risk of the coronavirus, authorities shortened the usual parade route, which normally culminates at the 17th century Red Fort. The number of people watching the parade was limited and included only fully vaccinated adults and children over 15 who have had at least one dose of vaccine. All spectators were required to wear masks and observe social distance. On Wednesday, India’s health ministry reported 285,000 new cases, including both delta and omicron variants, and 665 deaths across the country in the past 24 hours, with a test positivity rate of 16.16%. Hungary’s daily tally of new Covid-19 infections has jumped to a record 20,174 today, but Reuters report that government data shows the number of patients being treated in hospital has remained at a relatively low level. There are 3,145 coronavirus patients in hospital now, including 164 on ventilators, the government said. Andrew Sparrow is up and running early for us today with the UK politics live blog. You can find that here. I will be continuing on this blog with coronavirus news from around the world. The prevalence of Covid in the UK has fallen overall in recent weeks, but has risen in school-age children say researchers who have warned the uptick could pose a risk to adults. The latest data from the React-1 study, which is based on more than 100,000 swabs from randomly selected individuals in England collected between 5 and 20 January this year, shows that the overall weighted prevalence of Covid was 4.41%, with 99% of positive tests involving the Omicron variant. The team note the overall prevalence is more than three-fold higher than the previous round in December 2021. “[It] is by far the highest we’ve seen throughout the pandemic,” said Prof Paul Elliott of Imperial College London, and who led the study. The team add among those aged 75 years and older the prevalence increased almost 12-fold between rounds, however Elliott noted prevalence was highest in the latest round of the study in children aged 5-11 years, at 7.81%. While the team add that during January, prevalence overall was found to be decreasing, among children aged 5-17 it rose. That, they write is “likely the consequence of the peak occurring during the end-of-year school break, causing a delay to school-based transmission among children,” noting the rise could pose a risk to adults. “Clearly there is a risk of transmission from the children to adults, even though currently the adults the rates are decreasing,” said Elliott. The study also reveals around two-thirds of those who tested positive in the latest round reported previously having had a confirmed Covid infection – although the Elliott noted that could have been at any point during the pandemic, meaning not all may be true reinfections. However the team say the finding suggests there are certain groups have an ongoing higher risk of being exposed to the coronavirus. While the researchers say vaccination remains the mainstay of the defence against Covid, particularly given the protection it offers against hospitalisation, other approaches might be needed. “Further measures beyond vaccination may be required if the very high rates of Omicron infection persist, despite Omicron appearing to be intrinsically less likely to cause severe disease,” they write. Here’s the video clip of UK foreign secretary Liz Truss – complete with awkward pause – denying that she attended or was invited to any parties during lockdown. The key lines from UK foreign secretary Liz Truss on Sky News are that she has reiterated her 100% support for the prime minister, she has said that she herself attended no parties during lockdown, and she also said – albeit with a slight pause – that she had not been invited to any parties during lockdown. She declined, when asked, to call for Labour leader Keir Starmer to also be investigated by police over having a beer in a constituency office. Beyond that she said “I’m not going to prejudice the findings of the Sue Gray report, or indeed, the police investigation” or words to that effect quite a lot. She said: I believe that he’s done a fantastic job as prime minister, whether it’s delivering Brexit, delivering the Covid vaccines, the booster programmes. We’ve now got a much faster growing economy than many of our competitors, thanks to his work, and I believe that’s what we should focus on … I don’t think it’s helpful to speculate on specific claims or specific accusations about what may or may not have happened. A quick snap from Reuters here that the Czech Republic has recorded 39,614 new Covid-19 infections for its highest daily tally since the pandemic began, health ministry data showed on Wednesday. Tuesday’s figure is the week’s second highest in the nation, after 30,367 infections were found on Monday in the country of 10.7 million people, which is bracing for an expected peak in Omicron infections this month. Our political editor Heather Stewart has five things to look out for from the Sue Gray report when it is published. She identifies these key questions: What was the prime minister’s direct involvement in lockdown breaches? What does Gray say about the culture in No 10 and who is responsible? Which senior civil servants and advisers are named – and shamed? Are any other ministers, aside from Johnson, implicated? Has Gray found evidence of carousing upstairs in the flat Johnson shares with his wife, Carrie? You can find her answers here: “We will absolutely publish the findings of the report … unless there is some specific issue” is the line that UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has immediately taken on Sky News this morning over the Sue Gray report. Asked whether Boris Johnson would have to resign if he had broken the law or misled parliament, she said: The prime minister has appeared before parliament. He has apologised for what has happened. He has admitted that mistakes were made, and I 100% support him and want him to continue as prime minister. Hello from London. It is Martin Belam here taking over from Samantha Lock. As you know by now, I usually bring you quotes and key lines from whichever government minister in the UK is on the airwaves. Sky News and Times Radio are promising they will have Liz Truss on, although Good Morning Britain are suggesting they haven’t had any minister confirmed. Speaking of reinfections, here is a handy guide compiled by Guardian science correspondent Nicola Davis. According to the latest figures for England from the UKHSA, from the start of the pandemic up to 9 January this year there were 425,890 possible reinfections, with 109,936 found in the week ending 9 January, accounting for almost 11% of all cases that week. Read the full analysis below. Two-thirds of people recently infected with the Omicron variant say they had Covid previously, according to a new British study. The REACT (REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission) research team swap-tested thousands of volunteers across England. Almost two out of every three Covid-positive participants reported having had Covid before, according to the findings published by the Imperial College London on Wednesday. “Among the 3,582 swab-positive individuals reporting whether or not they had had previous infection, 2,315 (64.6%) reported a confirmed previous infection,” the report read. The researchers concluded that past infection was associated with a high risk of reinfection with Omicron. However, more work is needed to determine how many of the results are true reinfections or PCR tests which may have picked up old traces of the virus. Risks of infection were found to increase among people living in large compared to single-person households, those in more deprived areas and among people of Asian, Black and other ethnicities, according to the findings. The research programme, commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and carried out by Imperial College London, is in partnership with Ipsos MORI and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. South Korea’s daily new coronavirus cases has exceeded 13,000 for the first time, according to data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The record of 13,012 comes just a day after the tally topped 8,000 for the first time amid a rapid spread of the Omicron variant and despite an extension of tough social distancing rules. Omicron is likely to account for more than 90% of new infections over the next few weeks, with the daily numbers surging to 20,000 to 30,000 or more, health officials said. The variant became dominant in the country last week. “Going forward, our top priority is to reduce critically ill patients and deaths,” prime minister Kim Boo-kyum told an inter-ministry meeting on Wednesday. A new testing policy has taken effect in four designated cities on a pilot basis, under which only priority groups can take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test while others should get a rapid antigen test first at a local clinic. The programme will be expanded on 29 January to include some 256 state-run testing stations nationwide, and then hundreds of local clinics starting 3 February, Kim said. The government has also cut mandatory isolation for people who have been vaccinated but tested positive to seven days from 10, as part of efforts to free up resources for serious cases. The Dutch government will today further ease Covid restrictions despite record numbers of infections, with restaurants, bars and theatres set to re-open on Wednesday. Prime minister Mark Rutte told a news conference on Tuesday: The Netherlands has missed you. Today we are taking a big step to further unlock the Netherlands. That feels contradictory while the contamination figures are going through the roof, and we have to be clear that we are taking a risk. Rutte said the decision was in response to “great tensions” with the hospitality and cultural sectors over a virtual lockdown imposed days before Christmas. Anger mounted after shops, gyms, hairdressers and sex workers were allowed to resume business on 15 January, but other venues had to stay shut. Cafes in several cities opened in defiance of the restrictions the weekend before last, while dozens of museums even opened as well as beauty salons for a day in protest, Agence France-Presse reports. The European country is currently seeing record numbers of coronavirus cases, with new infections running at around 60,000 a day, fuelled by the Omicron variant. However, intensive care admissions and deaths have been falling. Cafes, bars and restaurants can open again until 10pm, so long as patrons have a Covid pass, wear masks when not seated, and capacity is reduced, the government said. Cinemas, theatres and museums may also welcome back customers, but nightclubs must stay closed for the time being. Fans can also return to football matches and other professional sports, but stadium capacity will be limited. Quarantine rules for schools will also be relaxed, with classes no longer having to shut if three or more cases are confirmed, and children under 18 need no longer isolate after contact with an infected person. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog to unravel all the latest Covid developments. Amid the chaos surrounding alleged Downing Street lockdown breaches it may be easy to forget we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. However, the saga is set to enter a new phase with an official report by senior civil servant Sue Gray due to be published in the coming days. Arch-critics of prime minister Boris Johnson are hopeful that Gray’s findings will be damaging enough to trigger what they believe will be the final trickle of letters needed to get to 54 and force a no confidence vote. Just across the UK border in the Netherlands, the Dutch government will further ease Covid restrictions despite record numbers of infections, with restaurants, bars and theatres set to re-open on Wednesday. “The Netherlands has missed you,” prime minister Mark Rutte told a news conference on Tuesday. “Today we are taking a big step to further unlock the Netherlands. That feels contradictory while the contamination figures are going through the roof, and we have to be clear that we are taking a risk.” The Netherlands has so far endured some of Europe’s toughest Covid restrictions. Here are all the global Covid developments from the past 24 hours: Europe: Boris Johnson said he welcomes a police inquiry into Downing Street parties and will help “draw a line” under matters. Earlier, Metropolitan police said they would begin investigating parties held at No 10 during coronavirus lockdowns. The development piles further pressure on the prime minister after fresh revelations of two more gatherings, including one to celebrate his birthday. Sue Gray’s inquiry report is reportedly set to come this week after the Met said there is no need to hold material back. The UK reported 439 deaths within 28 days of a Covid-positive test. That’s the highest tally since February 2021. Tuesday’s data showed 94,326 new daily cases. The figures are often higher on a Tuesday when most deaths at the weekend are included in the tally. Last Tuesday, 438 deaths were reported. The UK’s health secretary, Sajid Javid, said 77,000 NHS workers remain unvaccinated, and Covid policies – including on mandatory jabs for NHS staff – should be kept “under review”. Scotland will allow people to return to offices from Monday, in a “phased” plan announced by Nicola Sturgeon. The first minister asked employers to begin a phased return to work by introducing hybrid working next week after a continuing decline in Omicron variant cases in Scotland, in an update to MSPs at Holyrood. Italy’s daily cases have more than doubled in a day to 186,740. This is up from 77,696 a day earlier, the health ministry said. The number of deaths jumped to 468 from 352, though more tests had been taken in the past day than on Monday. In Germany, the anti-vaccination movement is ramping up, with thousands of people taking part in weekly protests across the country. More than 2,000 rallies were held on Monday. Russia has cut the isolation time for Covid contacts from 14 days to seven, amid a surge in infections driven by the Omicron variant. On Tuesday, daily cases reached the record high of 67,809, official figures show. Doctors have discovered an “antibody signature” that can help identify patients most at risk of developing long Covid. Malta will start to scrap a requirement for people to present a vaccination certificate for entry to restaurants and other venues from next month. Bars, restaurants and theatres in the Netherlands can reopen on 26 January, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said, further relaxing restrictions despite record infection levels. United States: The US Department of Labor said it will withdraw its Covid-19 vaccine-and-testing requirement for large employers after the Supreme Court blocked the rule. An appeals judge has temporarily restored New York’s mask mandate on Tuesday, a day after a judge in a lower court ruled that Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration lacked the constitutional authority to order people to wear face coverings. Elton John has postponed two farewell concert dates in Dallas, Texas, after contracting Covid-19.

article36,Denmark accuses UK of breaking Brexit fishing deal over trawling ban,2021-11-17 15:39:46,"['Brexit', 'Fishing industry', 'Denmark', 'UK news']","Denmark has accused the UK of breaching the post-Brexit fisheries deal over plans to ban destructive bottom trawling in a North Sea conservation zone. The UK announced in February that it wanted to ban bottom trawling at the Dogger Bank conservation zone in the North Sea, a move hailed by environmentalists hopeful of seeing a resurgence of halibut, sharks and skate in the once marine life rich sandbank. In an interview with the Guardian, Denmark’s fisheries minister, Rasmus Prehn, said such plans were not in line with the post-Brexit deal. “The Brexit agreement ensures full access [for EU vessels] to fish in UK waters until 2026. And therefore, of course, it is a very big problem for us if the British government is going to change that. We find that unacceptable and it’s a breach of our agreement,” he said. The charge opens a new front for the UK government, which is already embroiled in a rancorous dispute with France over fishing rights, against a wider backdrop of post-Brexit tensions with the EU. Dogger Bank, a large shallow sandbank about 90 miles north-east of the Humber estuary, has been fished by Danish boats for centuries and is among the country’s most important fishing grounds, according to the Danish government. Under the Brexit trade and cooperation agreement struck between the EU and the UK last Christmas Eve, EU fishers can continue to access UK waters as before until 30 June 2026, a transition to delay the blow of reduced fishing rights in future. The deal also commits both sides to “promoting the long-term sustainability” of the 70 common fish in the shared waters. Prehn said Danish fishers “are already in a very difficult situation due to Brexit so this would be even more difficult for them and we can’t really accept that”. While he said it was premature to discuss potential retaliation, he revealed his disappointment over how relations between the UK and Denmark had deteriorated since Brexit. “It’s really difficult to make an agreement and just one year after we have these problems with one part; that is not really acceptable, that is not how we usually make agreements. With the UK we used to have a very good relationship,” Prehn said. He was speaking from Brussels as the UK and EU embark on the final sprint of negotiations to set catch limits for fishing in 2022, ahead of a 10 December deadline. Denmark and the UK entered the then European Economic Community together in 1973, but arrived too late to influence the first version of the common fisheries policy, leaving a lingering sense of resentment for British officials. Between 2013 and 2020, Danish fishers landed catches worth 27m DKK (£3.05m) a year from bottom trawling in Dogger Bank, mostly sand eel, which is used on fish farms but is also an important source of food for puffins, kittiwakes and seals. Germany and the Netherlands also have fishing interests in Dogger Bank, which environmentalists say has been overworked by trawls and dredges, causing a drastic decline in fish. Bottom trawling involves dragging weighted nets across the sea floor. Environmentalists have welcomed the government’s decision to protect Dogger Bank, but said the UK needed to show the same efforts when it came to protecting fish targeted by British fishers. “The UK is proposing a brave and good deal on the Dogger Bank,” said Irene Kingma, a Dutch marine biologist. “It’s also very easy … when it’s not your fisheries that you’re impacting.” “The UK is being very progressive on all environmental issues as long as it’s not interfering with their own fishing interest,” she added. “They are good at [protecting] Dogger Bank, because its flatfish are fished by the Dutch, and they are good at the industrial fisheries [sandeel] because that’s fished by the Danish. But they are very much not willing to move on cod when it’s the Scottish fishing boats.” The UK government rejects the claim it is in breach of the TCA, arguing it allows both sides to decide on regulatory measures. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The UK is a global leader in the fight to protect our seas. As an independent coastal state the UK can decide on the regulatory measures which apply to fishing in our waters, which includes taking measures to follow scientific advice and protect our marine environment.”"
article37,Who is Salman Rushdie? Author whose book The Satanic Verses made him a target,2022-08-13 00:51:28,"['Salman Rushdie', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Islam', 'Religion', 'Religion', 'New York', 'US news', 'World news', 'UK news']","Salman Rushdie has been taken to hospital after being attacked on stage at an event in New York. Rushdie suffered “an apparent stab wound to the neck” according to a statement released shortly after the incident by state police. His interviewer also suffered a minor head injury, police said. Video footage shows audience members surging on to the stage to help. The assailant, who eyewitnesses claim was wearing a black mask, was restrained and taken into custody. Who is Salman Rushdie? Rushdie is an Indian-born, British Booker prize-winning author. He has written 14 novels, but is best known for his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses. In 2007, Rushdie was knighted for his services to literature. He has been living in the US since 2000. Why has his work led to death threats? The Satanic Verses – inspired in part by the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, garnered critical acclaim in the UK and won the Whitbread award for novel of the year in 1988. However, it also caused major controversy as some Muslims accused the text of blasphemy and of mocking Islam. It sparked a series of protests across the UK attended by thousands of British Muslims, many of which involved publicly burning the book. A year later, Iran’s late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini banned the book in Iran, and issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie’s death. It said: “I inform all zealous Muslims of the world that the author of the book entitled The Satanic Verses – which has been compiled, printed and published in opposition to Islam, the Prophet, and the Qur’an – and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are sentenced to death. “I call on all zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever they may be found, so that no one else will dare to insult the Muslim sanctities. God Willing, whoever is killed on this path is a martyr.” What has happened since the fatwa was issued? A bounty of more than £2.5m ($3m) had been offered to anyone who kills Rushdie. The author was forced into hiding under police protection for nine years, but had dismissed that threat at the time, saying there was “no evidence” of people being interested in the reward. In 2012, a semi-official Iranian religious foundation raised the bounty for Rushdie from to $3.3m. Later, in 2019, a Twitter account connected to Ayatollah Khomeini was temporarily banned after tweeting “Imam Khomeini’s verdict regarding Salman Rushdie is based on divine verses and just like divine verses, it is solid and irrevocable”. Have there been previous attempts on Rushdie’s life? There have been a number of failed assassination attempts on Rushdie, as well as attacks on translators of the text. In 1991 Hitoshi Igarashi, who had translated The Satanic Verses into Japanese, was stabbed to death in his office in the University of Tsukuba by an unknown attacker. Where else has The Satanic Verses been banned? The book has been banned in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, Singapore, Venezuela."
article38,Denmark to outlaw life sentence prisoners starting new romances,2021-09-17 09:52:57,"['Denmark', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Privacy']","Prisoners serving life sentences in Denmark are to be prevented from starting new romantic relationships after it emerged a 17-year-old fell in love with Peter Madsen, the murderer of the journalist Kim Wall, while he was in jail. For the first 10 years of their imprisonment, long-term inmates’ contacts, by letter, phone or online, will be limited to people they already knew before they entered prison, under legislation tabled by the social democrat-led government. “We have seen distasteful examples in recent years of prisoners who have committed vile crimes contacting young people in order to gain their sympathy and attention,” the justice minister, Nick Hækkerup, said. “This must obviously be stopped.” The six-point bill, which has the backing of the centre-right opposition and should come into force in January, will also stop long-term prisoners being allowed to post freely about their offences on social media or discuss them on podcasts. At present, long-term inmates can write to, call and have visits from people they did not know before they were imprisoned, and share details of their offences online. Jails should not serve as “dating centres or media platforms to brag about crimes”, Hækkerup said. The bill follows public outcry at the way Madsen, who murdered then dismembered Wall in 2017 when she went to interview him on his homemade submarine, was able to form relationships with at least two women while in jail. The inventor, who was convicted of premeditated murder, aggravated sexual assault and desecrating a corpse but only confessed to Wall’s murder in a TV documentary last year, met and in 2020 married Jenny Curpen, 39, a Russian artist in Finland, after correspondence and visits that began soon after he was sentenced in April 2018. Madsen also had a phone and written relationship with Cammilla Kürstein, who first contacted him as a 17-year-old schoolgirl in 2017 and last year told the Danish public broadcaster DK in an emotional interview that she was “absolutely in love with him”. Human rights experts said they expected challenges to the new law. Jens Elo Rytter, of the University of Copenhagen, told the BT newspaper that on the face of it, the proposed ban on new relationships would “interfere with prisoners’ right to a private life”, while outlawing public statements might “raise questions about censorship”. Wall, who had written for the Guardian and the New York Times, was last seen alive on the submarine, the Nautilus, on 10 August 2017. Her dismembered torso was found floating off the coast of Copenhagen 10 days after she was reported missing. Her head, legs and clothes were discovered in bags at sea that October. Madsen, who was rescued shortly before the vessel sank, initially claimed to have set down the journalist on dry land. He subsequently changed his story, saying she had died when a heavy hatch cover accidentally fell on her head during their brief voyage on the 17-metre (56ft) submarine."
article39,"Unreleased John Lennon recording sells for £43,000 in Denmark",2021-09-28 16:57:21,"['John Lennon', 'The Beatles', 'Culture', 'Music', 'Denmark', 'Europe', 'World news']","A cassette tape recording of an interview by Danish schoolboys with John Lennon and Yoko Ono in which the Beatles star sings a previously unreleased song has been sold at auction in Copenhagen for £43,000. The 33-minute audio track was recorded by four teenagers as part of a report for their school magazine in January 1970, just months before the Beatles announced their breakup. The recording took place at a time when Lennon and Ono were calling for an end to the war in Vietnam. In 1969, the couple had staged their iconic ‘bed-ins for peace’ at the Hilton hotel in Amsterdam and the Queen Elizabeth hotel in Montreal. They had come to Thy, a remote district of Jutland in north-west Denmark, to discuss, what would in time, prove to be the thorny issue of child arrangements for Ono’s five-year-old daughter, Kyoko, who was living with her ex-husband Tony Cox in the area. The visit had initially gone without incident but such was the couple’s fame at the time that a media frenzy quickly gathered pace as word spread of their presence in the country. They felt forced to hold an impromptu press conference, and armed with a tape recorder borrowed from a hi-fi shop, four Danish teenagers persuaded their teacher to allow them a day off to cover the event for their school. Karsten Hoejen, who made the recording, recalled that by the time they had made their way through a snowstorm, the press conference was over and the world’s media had moved on. But the four boys were nevertheless invited in. “We were a bunch of 16-year-old hippies,” he told the BBC. “As we arrived everyone was leaving … We went into the living room and saw John and Yoko sitting on the sofa, it was fantastic. We sat down with them and were quite close to each other.” “We talked, we had a good time,” said Hoejen, 68. “John asked me, ‘where do you come from? A radio station?’ ‘No, from a school magazine,’ I said.” On the tape, Lennon’s unmistakable voice is heard responding to the question of how four young boys could contribute to the peace movement. “If you can’t think of any ideas yourself, imitate what we do,” he says. “Sit down and think ‘what can we do locally’?” Lennon is also heard complaining about the Beatles’ image and discussing the length of his hair. Hoejen said the meeting was “very cosy” and “relaxed”, with Lennon and Ono sat on a sofa, alongside Kyoko, Cox and his wife, Melinda. “[They] were sat with their feet on the table in their woollen socks.” The couple joined in a Danish tradition and danced around a Christmas tree, then Hoejen asked Lennon to play a song on a guitar. He gave a rendition of Give Peace a Chance, with a few ad libs, before performing a short tune called Radio Peace, which was due to be the theme tune for a radio station Lennon hoped to launch in Amsterdam. “The radio station was never opened and the song was never released,” Hoejen said. “To our knowledge, the only place where this song exists is on our tape.” It was only decades later that Hoejen realised the tape’s worth and stored it away in a bank vault. He and his friends said they decided to auction the cassette given the difficulties in deciding how it would be shared among their children. The cassette was being auctioned alongside an original copy of the school newspaper and 23 photographs, and is was listed with a guide price of 200,000 to 300,000 Danish krone (£23,000 to £35,000), ultimately selling for 370,000 Danish krone (£43,000) at the Bruun Rasmussen auction house in Copenhagen. There is no digital copy of the recording and the current owners have maintained exclusive rights over it, preventing media outlets from playing the unreleased song. However, there is understood to be considerable interest in the recording from some unidentified museums, raising hopes it will be available to the public in the future. “A recording like this is indeed very rare,” said the auction house’s director Alexa Bruun Rasmussen. “We are not sure that there are any other recordings like this one, because it’s an unofficial recording.”"
article40,Gas prices rise in Europe as fears grow Russia may halt supplies via Ukraine,2022-09-28 12:02:24,"['Gas', 'Europe', 'Ukraine', 'Business', 'Commodities', 'World news', 'Russia', 'Nord Stream 1 pipeline', 'Nord Stream 2 pipeline', 'Energy industry']","Gas prices have risen on fears that Russia could halt supplies to Europe through Ukraine, adding to turmoil caused by damage to the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea. The Kremlin-controlled gas company Gazprom said it could impose sanctions on Ukraine’s Naftogaz due to ongoing arbitration. The statement came after the discovery of leaks on the two Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea near the Danish island of Bornholm in a suspected act of sabotage, although exactly by whom or why remains unconfirmed. The Dutch gas price for delivery next month – the European benchmark – was up €16.10 at €200.1 per megawatt hour (MWh) on Wednesday and the British equivalent was up by 24.75p at 290.25p per therm. Gazprom said it had rejected all claims from Naftogaz in arbitration proceedings over Russian gas transit, and had notified the arbitration court. It also said Russia could introduce sanctions against the Ukrainian energy company, which would prohibit Gazprom from paying Kyiv the transit fees if it further pursues an arbitration case over gas transit. Russian gas travels into Europe via Ukraine via several key routes, including the Brotherhood, Soyuz and Yamal-Europe pipelines. Transgas, which starts in the west of Ukraine and flows into Germany, could also be affected. Russian gas flows through Ukraine have been steady at about 42m cubic metres a day in recent weeks. Gas prices had already been pushed higher this week on the surprise news of the leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines. However, although Nord Stream 2 contained gas, it had never started up commercial operation, while flows via Nord Stream 1 have been halted since late August, limiting the immediate impact of the damage. Flows via those routes are now seen as unlikely to return. Denmark and Sweden have said major leaks on the two pipelines in the Baltic Sea were caused by deliberate acts of sabotage carried out in each of the two countries’ exclusive economic zones. A western official told Reuters: “The multiple explosions at the same time – it’s very serious, and is going to have to be investigated.” Norway’s Equinor, Europe’s largest gas supplier, said on Wednesday it had stepped up security measures at its installations after the suspected sabotage. The Kremlin said claims that Russia was behind a possible attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines were “predictably stupid”. Analysts at Refinitiv said the impact of the current UK cold snap has been mitigated by increased Norwegian flows and supplies of liquefied natural gas imported from around the world. However, the pound’s plunge against the dollar will increase the cost of the gas bought in dollars for British importers. The surge in the price of gas came after weeks of declines in its price, buoyed by an improving picture for European supplies this winter due to efforts to fill up storage facilities. However, industry watchers are concerned that by next spring, European gas facilities could be nearly empty without any Russian gas to refill them."
article41,Che Adams secures Scotland play-off seeding in superb win over Denmark,2021-11-15 22:02:28,"['World Cup 2022 qualifiers', 'Scotland', 'Denmark', 'Football', 'Sport']","Not content to simply progress to the World Cup play-offs, Scotland decided they may as well secure a home semi-final by virtue of seeding. This victory over a previously imperious Denmark team on a special evening on Glasgow’s south side proved the fitting conclusion to a successful campaign for Steve Clarke and his team. Scotland have won six competitive games in a row for the first time since 1930. Their only frustration is associated with the wait until March for the first of two games Clarke hopes will return this international side to a World Cup after a wait stretching back to 1998. On this evidence, Scotland have nothing to fear. They rattled, harassed and outplayed Denmark. “Everything came together,” said Clarke. “We were always on the front foot. It was a really good night for us. “When I came into this job there was a lot of negativity around. Now there’s a lot of positivity and the players love it. The players like to be loved and they feel the love of the crowd which is great.” Clarke’s team closed just four points behind the Danes in Group F. Seeding will render what comes next slightly easier, with Hampden Park in this raucous form quite the backdrop. The switch in public attitudes towards the Scotland team was demonstrated by the scarcity of available tickets for this encounter. Under Clarke, the upwardly mobile Scots have broken the mould of failed campaign after failed campaign. Following this team has become fashionable once more. It was typical of the manager’s approach that this fixture was deemed significant despite the play-off berth being secured days earlier in Moldova. Understandable Clarke focus also fell on officialdom. Five of the starting XI here – Stephen O’Donnell, Billy Gilmour, John McGinn, Che Adams and Andy Robertson – would be suspended for the play-off semi final if collecting a yellow card. No Scotland players were booked as the Danes were swatted aside. Denmark’s direct progress to Qatar was sealed long ago. They arrived in Glasgow seeking to complete the perfect 10 out of 10 qualifying wins. In the midst of their run was a comprehensive dismissal of Scotland in Copenhagen. After a bright Scottish start, the visitors served notice of their intentions via Daniel Wass. The Valencia midfielder, arriving late in the penalty area, bundled narrowly wide from Rasmus Kristensen’s cross. Scotland remained hugely competitive. Midway through the opening half, in concluding a sweeping move kept alive by the tenacity of Ryan Christie, Adams forced Kasper Schmeichel to a terrific save with an outstretched foot. The majority of Hampden was already on its feet to acclaim the opening goal. There began a concerted spell of Scotland pressure. Adams was denied a wonderful goal, following a break as included a spectacular Christie pass, by Simon Kjaer’s despairing block. Denmark were helpless, though, to prevent John Souttar’s opener. The Hearts defender, who has endured a horrible time with serious injury, delivered a moment of huge personal significance by nodding home from six yards. Liam Cooper had earlier headed McGinn’s corner perfectly into Souttar’s path. The 25-year-old’s celebration supplied evidence of his earlier turmoil. Matters simmered down to a dull roar in the opening stages of the second half. Set pieces appeared Scotland’s best hope of a crucial second, with Schmeichel looking surprisingly ill at ease under cross balls. Not that open play was completely ineffective; Gilmour tested the Leicester City custodian from long range before Adams cracked a post from a narrow angle. The Southampton forward, who was terrific all evening, was belatedly flagged offside but Tartan Army belief continued to rise. That Robertson, the Scotland captain, limped off with 11 minutes to play placed a minor dampener on the evening for the hosts. Smiles were soon returned to faces. The outstanding Adams stayed onside, ran onto Stuart Armstrong’s through pass and slammed beyond Schmeichel. Hampden erupted. The Clarke-led revival of this scene deserves the most fulsome of praise."
article42,Noma wins world’s best restaurant as Denmark claims top two spots ,2021-10-06 15:52:34,"['Restaurants', 'Food', 'Denmark', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Chefs']","Copenhagen has confirmed its reputation as the global dining destination of the moment after its top eateries finished first and second in the 2021 World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards, widely considered the Oscars of gastronomy. The new Noma from the chef René Redzepi, famed for his foraging and fermenting techniques, was named best restaurant at a ceremony in Antwerp, Belgium, on Tuesday night. The old one topped the list in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014 and came second in 2019. “No trip to Noma is ever the same,” the citation said, mentioning highlights from previous seasons including a vegetarian celeriac shawarma and a duck dish of leg, brain and heart served with “claw, feather and beak”. William Drew, the director of content for the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, said Noma had “arguably been the most influential restaurant of its generation, setting new standards in terms of research and ingredient sourcing, dish development and presentation”. Staff at Noma – whose current “game &amp; forest season” menu costs 2,800 Danish kroner (£320), plus 1,800 kroner for the accompanying wines, and according to social media posts features raw sumac, bear and reindeer brain – exploded with joy at the news. The annual list is voted on by more than 1,000 gastronomes including food writers and critics, chefs, restaurateurs and international culinary experts, who this year awarded second place to another Michelin three-star Copenhagen eatery, Geranium. Its current 16-course “autumn universe” menu created by Rasmus Kofoed features artichoke leaves and pickled walnut, squid, melted smoked lard, essence of yeast, potatoes and quail with thyme seeds, berries and pickled pine. Noma has been the flagship of “New Nordic” cuisine since 2004, when Redzepi and the restaurant’s co-founder, Claus Meyer, joined 10 other Nordic chefs in publishing a 10-point manifesto aimed at developing the region’s “authentic cuisine”. The manifesto emphasised “purity, simplicity and freshness”, urged a predominance of seasonal and hyperlocal foods, and encouraged restaurants to develop traditional Nordic fish and meat recipes by reviving and adapting older techniques such as marinating, smoking and salting. Native ingredients such as foraged herbs, cloudberries and local shellfish were combined with exotic additions such as wild reindeer blood, ants and cricket paste, creating culinary headlines worldwide and sparking a wave of successful restaurant openings that included Geranium, which opened in 2007. Melina Shannon-DiPietro, the executive director of MAD (Danish for food), a foundation founded in 2011 by Redzepi with the aim of transforming the restaurant business and hospitality and forcing fundamental change in food systems, said the awards had sparked “incredible pride” in Denmark. “In fact, both chefs would probably say they were now moving beyond New Nordic,” she said. “The principles still apply, of course: they’re united by a real respect for nature, which obviously changes food fundamentally, but also by collaboration, and by wanting to be the best workplace – for employees, producers, the environment.” She said the movement’s success had attracted “amazingly international teams” to Nordic kitchens, creating “a new spirit of open-mindedness, a willingness to explore and blur boundaries, an awareness of being in a global community”. New Nordic was still true to its principles, but evolving, she said. Noma picked up a coveted third Michelin star this year, with praise for its “strong connection to nature and holistic approach … which sees unusual seasonal ingredients showcased in creative and complex dishes.” No award was given last year because of the pandemic, and this year’s title means Noma, which first opened in the Danish capital’s Christianshavn district in 2003, is level with Ferran Adrià’s El Bulli for the most top finishes. A rule introduced in 2019 in principle prevents previous winners, including Eleven Madison Park in New York, Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck in Bray, UK, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France, from competing, but Noma qualified because it closed in 2016, reopening at a new address and with a different concept two years later. Despite a judging panel made up of 50% men and 50% women, the list drew criticism, as in previous years, for featuring “male-dominant, European-heavy, expensive tasting-menu restaurants”, with just four restaurants in the top 50 headed by female chefs – one fewer than in 2019.. A third New Nordic restaurant, Frantzèn in Stockholm, placed sixth, while two Spanish restaurants, Asador Extebarri in Axpe and Disfrutar in Barcelona, finished in the top five. Central and Maido in Lima, Peru were also in the top 10, with two well-known Paris restaurants, Arpège and Septime, in the top 25. In the UK, the Clove Club (“‘modern British’ creations that put forward natural flavours and playfully mingle with tradition”) and Lyle’s (“a short and sweet micro-seasonal menu … showcasing what’s best on any given day in London and the UK”), both in London, finished 32nd and 33rd respectively.

article43,"Flee: inside the film about a Kabul boy who finds happiness, cats and a husband in Denmark",2022-02-01 06:00:10,"['Animation in film', 'Documentary films', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Denmark', 'Immigration and asylum', 'Refugees', 'Sexuality', 'World news', 'Society']","When the Danish film-maker Jonas Poher Rasmussen was 15, an Afghan refugee moved to his small village. Rumours circulated about how the boy, Amin, had got there. Some said he had walked all the way from Kabul, others that he had seen his whole family slaughtered. Rasmussen became the newcomer’s friend and confidant – Amin even came out to him as gay when they were teenagers – and their closeness endured into adulthood. When they both suffered bad break-ups in their 20s, for instance, Rasmussen went to stay with Amin; they refer to that period now as “the heartbreak summer”. He still didn’t know the truth about how his friend came to Denmark, though, so he did what any documentarist might do: he proposed making a film about him. Amin refused to reveal his identity on screen – but what if the film were animated? The result is Flee, which alternates between scenes of Rasmussen interviewing his friend, dramatisations of Amin’s perilous journey to Copenhagen via Moscow, and present-day interludes showing him househunting with his boyfriend in which the concept of settling down presents unique challenges for someone who has spent his life running. Aside from the occasional excerpt of archive footage – the war-scarred streets of Kabul, the unruly waves seen from a boat smuggling people across the Baltic – every frame of the movie is animated, most of it in a simple, straightforwardly realistic fashion that matches Amin’s narration. “Fundamentally, everything came from his testimony,” says the 40-year-old director. We are speaking via video call just before Christmas, at the end of a year that began with Flee (which is executive-produced by Riz Ahmed and the Game of Thrones star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) winning the Grand Jury prize in the documentary section at Sundance. “It had to be a style of animation that supported what Amin said. It also had to represent authentically the streets of Kabul and Moscow in the 1980s rather than being stylised or otherworldly.” When Amin frolics as a child in his sister’s dresses or bops happily to the sound of A-ha, the mood is bright and buoyant. In moments of trauma, the animation grows nightmarish: faces appear without features, surroundings become scratchy and abstract. “Again, that came from the voice. When Amin started to talk about trauma, he spoke more slowly and incoherently. I knew we needed to see that reflected in the animation. It’s not about the reality any more, it’s about the emotion inside, the anger and fear.” Flee provides harrowing glimpses into the refugee experience but in places the movie is playful and funny. The young Amin, a devout fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, imagines his idol winking at him in the middle of a fight scene from Bloodsport. Later, when Amin is squashed next to a dishy older man while being driven in a van by people smugglers, the soundtrack (Joyride by Roxette) seems to be expressing his taboo desires. The partial disguise of animation gives Amin, who is hiding behind an assumed name as well as a cartoon face, a way to tell his story in full for the first time. “He didn’t want people to pity him, or to see him only as a refugee,” Rasmussen explains. It’s impossible not to notice, though, that Amin isn’t the only person whose appearance has been altered on screen. The film-maker talking to me today looks nothing like the one who is shown interviewing his friend in Flee. “Ah, my non-blondness,” he says sheepishly, gesturing to his dark hair and beard. “I wanted to create a contrast between Amin and me so that people weren’t confused.” It also reflects the story’s unreliable nature, where rumour and subterfuge are gradually peeled away to reveal the truth. “What we’re seeing on screen doesn’t always match up with the real world.” He confesses to a more personal reason, too. “I didn’t want the audience to question where I’m from. In my own family, there is a refugee background. My maternal grandmother was born in Copenhagen but her parents, who were Jewish, had fled Russia in the pogroms. They applied for asylum here but were rejected, then moved on to Berlin. Being Jewish, my grandmother had to stand up every day in class with a yellow star on her chest. After that, they had to flee again – to England and then the US.” Rasmussen insists that he didn’t feel like an outsider himself during his childhood in Denmark, though there was one detail that set him apart. “All my friends were blond,” he says. “At 11 or 12, I wanted to be blond, too. And now I had the chance.” He looks bashful and boyish: a kid who made his wish come true. Flee was an emotional film to piece together. “I’d heard the rumours about Amin’s past so I expected it to be harrowing,” he says. “I was more surprised by how much it all still affected him. He wasn’t able to connect his past and his present so he didn’t feel like a whole person.” The most traumatic part for Rasmussen was sifting through footage from 1980s Afghanistan to find just the right snapshots of horror. “That was a tough few weeks,” he says. “I needed a lot of breaks. But we had to show that staying in Kabul was not an option. The kid you see lying in a pool of blood represents Amin if he had stayed.” In Rasmussen’s previous film, the live-action documentary What He Did, he used a different sort of framework to address horrifying events. That film told the story of Jens Michael Schau, who brutally murdered his partner, the novelist Christian Kampmann. In that instance, the rehearsal and performance of a new play about the killing provided a lens through which to explore the story on two levels of reality, just as animation does in Flee. Both films concern gay male outsiders – Schau admits he felt “inferior” in his partner’s literary circles, while Amin describes himself as being “ashamed and embarrassed” of being a refugee. The films also feature scenes set in gay bars. “I’m definitely drawn to outsider stories, to seeing how marginalised people cope in society,” says Rasmussen. Then a grin: “I’m not drawn to gay bar scenes. It’s just a coincidence I have two of those in a row.” Are the animation and the play-within-the-film ways of holding these subjects at an analytical distance? Quite the opposite, he argues. “When you deal with stories in the past, it’s always a struggle to make them feel current again. The setting up of the play in What He Did provides a natural structure. The same with the animation in Flee. It makes it all feel like it is happening now in front of our eyes.” And it is. There will be millions more people who are displaced like Amin in the coming years and decades, not only through war but also the climate emergency. “I hope it gives a human face to these stories,” he says. “When Amin arrived in Denmark, the rhetoric around refugees wasn’t so bad. In the last 20 years, it has become increasingly toxic. I want the film to show that being a refugee is not an identity – it’s a circumstance that can happen to anyone. Yes, Amin is a refugee but he’s so much more. He is an academic, a house owner, a husband.” How is he now? “He’s very well. He’s been travelling all his life and suddenly he had to stay at home like everybody else for the past few years. But he’s enjoyed it. He sends me photos of cats, and the flowers in the garden.” Does Rasmussen feel as if he has finally understood Amin after making Flee? “I don’t think you can get to the bottom of a living person,” he says. “We’re all works in progress. I do understand him a lot better, and I understand what it does to someone to lose your home and not be fully who you are. In Afghanistan, he couldn’t be openly gay. In Denmark, he couldn’t be honest about his past. All his life, parts of himself had to be hidden away. Flee is really the story of a man trying to find a place where he can be who he is.” Flee is released on 11 February."
article44,Brentford snap up Mikkel Damsgaard from Sampdoria for €15m,2022-08-10 11:55:39,"['Brentford', 'Sampdoria', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport']","Brentford have agreed a deal to sign the highly rated Denmark midfielder Mikkel Damsgaard from Sampdoria on a five-year deal for a fee of €15m (£12.7m). The 22-year-old has completed his medical and will become the club’s sixth summer signing. Damsgaard made 49 appearances in all competitions for Sampdoria, after joining the Serie A side in July 2020, but featured only 11 times last season after an injury-hit campaign. He also has 16 international caps, and played in five matches at Euro 2020 last summer, scoring two goals, including a memorable free-kick in Denmark’s 2-1 semi-final defeat to England at Wembley. Brentford’s first Premier League game this season ended in a 2-2 draw at Leicester last Sunday, and Damsgaard could make his debut in the club’s next league match, against Manchester United at home on Saturday."
article45,Manchester City thrash out draw at Copenhagen despite Sergio Gómez red,2022-10-11 19:07:19,"['Champions League', 'FC Copenhagen', 'Manchester City', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport']","Manchester City were as disjointed as they have been this season yet still emerged with a draw that secures qualification from Champions League Group G after Sevilla failed to beat Borussia Dortmund. On a night when an exhausted Erling Haaland was rested, after starting all the previous 12 games, Pep Guardiola’s men did a rare thing: failed to score, though this and their lack of fluidity could be traced to Sergio Gómez’s first-half sending-off following a VAR review in a 45 minutes dominated – and, perhaps, blighted – by the out-of-stadium official. City also missed a penalty – Riyad Mahrez the culprit – but finished pleased with eking out a point that barring Sevilla, bottom of the standings, winning their last three matches, including by a high margin at the Etihad Stadium, means they motor to Liverpool on Sunday in relaxed mood. Guardiola professed himself content. “I’m really satisfied,” the manager said. “The team gave everything [especially with] 10-v-11.” Copenhagen were defiant throughout, as signalled by an early Hakon Arnar Haraldsson corner which was headed away by Kevin De Bruyne. City’s first real foray featured Julián Álvarez’s angled shot being tipped behind by Kamil Grabara, though no corner was awarded. This delighted the Parken Stadium faithful as much as what occurred when Rodri rifled a superb volley beyond their goalkeeper. For a first time Artur Dias, the referee, was ordered to the monitor by the VAR and he crossed out the strike owing to a Mahrez handball before Álvarez’s lay-off – the latter in the XI thanks to Guardiola giving the man-of-the-season (so far) a break. Despite being dismantled by the same opponents 5-0 last week Lukas Lerager further signalled the feistiness of Jacob Neestrup’s men, the midfielder’s 20-yard effort requiring a Ederson hand to deflect it out. When Haraldsson flighted in the corner City’s defenders ball-watched and the Brazilian again had to save his team. His opposite number, Grabara, did the same when Nicolai Boilesen was adjudged to have handled – again by Dias, again via the touchline TV – from a Mahrez corner and the referee pointed to the spot. The Algerian’s effort was to the goalkeeper’s right but he flung himself in that direction to save superbly. VAR and the pitchside monitor’s busy outing now had its third moment when Dias was told to review Gómez’s challenge on Haraldsson. The Spaniard was last man and when the referee finally saw replays of the incident – he had allowed play to continue for some seconds – a free-kick was given and the red card raised over the left-back who ambled off with no complaint. Cue Guardiola sacrificing Mahrez in a defensive rejig that had Rúben Dias coming on to operate in a three-man rearguard, as Manuel Akanji went to right wing-back and João Cancelo to the same role on the left. This was all ragged by the perfectionist standards of City, whose manager will have been concerned but, then, heartened regarding how they rallied to end the period on top, despite only having 10 players. For the second half Guardiola resisted introducing Haaland and, later, revealed why. “He finished the game against Southampton [at the weekend] so tired and didn’t recover well,” the Catalan said. “Monday [he] was not good, today a little better but not perfect so we decided not to take the risk.” The noise inside the venue remained vibrant and raucous, the home fans raising the volume when two corners were claimed as City were pinned back. Guardiola’s side ooze quality, of course, so there was no surprise to see Cancelo, Álvarez and De Bruyne skate upfield and engineer an opening for the peerless Belgian to test Grabara with a cutely curled attempt from range. “Spirited” was an apt characterisation of each team. Duramy, along Copenhagen’s left, looked to get at Dias when he could, embodying his side’s approach as, too, did Jack Grealish whose bursts of pace moved City the other way – the winger, in one moment, creating a chance for De Bruyne who blazed into the side-netting. The visitors’ instinct to rove forward had them still threatening Grabara’s goal as the seconds ticked on, Álvarez rising near the right post to steer a free header off target, while Marko Stamenic’s late 20-yard shot, though wide, was illustrative of how Copenhagen fought all night. Before kick-off their fans had sung a ditty to the tune of the Boomtown Rats’ song I Don’t Like Mondays. By the end City were quite partial to this Tuesday as this was job virtually done in a streetwise offering that showed how shrewd England’s champions now are in the elite continental competition. There will be far tougher challenges but, at the end of the match, they walked off content and so move on to facing Jürgen Klopp’s men which Guardiola at the weekend described as always being City’s litmus test."

Conor Washington’s sixth international goal gave Ian Baraclough’s side a half-time lead as they looked to have responded well to the controversial 2-0 defeat in Switzerland on Saturday, but it all went wrong after the break. Yasen Petrov shuffled his pack at half-time and got the rewards, although Todor Nedelev took the credit as he beat Bailey Peacock-Farrell in fine fashion twice in 11 minutes to turn things around just after the hour. It made for more frustration for Baraclough, who had finally built some positive momentum last month but has seen things unravel quickly in the past week, the Qatar dream now definitively dead. Baraclough told Sky Sports: “It was a game that we dominated. In the first half we created a good few chances, but we didn’t take the chances. At half-time we talked about intensity, about getting the ball moving again. We knew they’d have a spell and come at us, we’d have to deal with it and make sure we were winning balls and winning skirmishes for 20 minutes. “We didn’t stop that happening and they took two half-chances – they were half-chances, one on the edge of the box with a first-time strike, a great strike, and the second one was even better. If you talk about a team being clinical, there’s an example.” Denmark became the second European nation to reach Qatar 2022 after a 1-0 home win against Austria left them top of Group F with an unassailable lead over their rivals. After Germany advanced to the 32-nation tournament on Monday, the Danes secured their own berth as a 53rd-minute goal from Joakim Mæhle helped them to secure an eighth successive qualifying victory. Denmark missed several chances before Mæhle beat Daniel Bachmann with a neat finish inside the near post after good work by Thomas Delaney. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick, including two penalties in the opening 13 minutes, as Portugal swept past Luxembourg 5-0. Bruno Fernandes and João Palhinha were also on the scoresheet before Ronaldo nearly completed his treble with a brilliant control-and-overhead-kick combination. The 36-year-old Manchester United forward was not to be denied, though, popping up three minutes from time to seal his 10th international hat-trick. The Group I qualifier between Albania and Poland was suspended after bottles were thrown on the pitch from the crowd in the second half. The match was interrupted soon after the forward Karol Swiderski scored from inside the box following an assist from the the Leeds midfielder Mateusz Klich in the 77th minute. Poland’s 1-0 victory took them above Albania and leaves them just three points behind England, who drew at home to Hungary, with two matches let to play. Alexander Isak won a penalty that was converted by Emil Forsberg before scoring himself as Sweden beat Greece 2-0 to move to the top of Group B on 15 points, two ahead of Spain with two games left to play. Things did not start well for Swedes, who had the assistant referee and the woodwork to thank in the first half as an early goal by Giorgos Masouras was ruled out for offside and he also hit a post while Vangelis Pavlidis headed off the crossbar. Isak was felled in the box by Konstantinos Mavropanos and Forsberg rattled the resulting spot-kick for his second penalty in two games. Isak added the second in the 69th minute, exploiting a hesitant Greek defence before rounding the keeper and calmly chipping the ball home."
article47,Denmark to lift all remaining Covid restrictions on 10 September,2021-08-27 13:25:00,"['Denmark', 'Coronavirus', 'World news', 'Europe']","Denmark is to lift all its remaining Covid-19 restrictions by 10 September after the health ministry declared the virus “no longer a critical threat to society” because of the country’s high level of vaccination. “The epidemic is under control, we have record vaccination levels,” the health minister, Magnus Heunicke, said in a statement on Friday. “That is why we can drop the special rules we had to introduce in the fight against Covid-19.” He warned, however, that even if the country was “in a good place right now”, the epidemic was not over and the government would not hesitate to “act quickly if the pandemic once again threatens the essential functioning of society”. Denmark is the EU’s third-most vaccinated country, according to Our World in Data, with 71% of the population having received two shots. Malta is on 80% and Portugal 73%. The UK has fully vaccinated 62% of its population. Denmark’s seven-day rolling average of new coronavirus cases per million inhabitants stands at 167, slightly above the EU average of 149 but well below Britain’s figure of 492, according to the same online science publication. The country was one of Europe’s first to impose a partial lockdown in March last year, closing schools and non-essential businesses and services. After tightening and relaxing anti-Covid measures throughout the pandemic, it was also one of the earliest to begin reopening, launching a “coronavirus passport” on 21 April this year. Danish restaurants, bars, cinemas, gyms, sports stadiums and hairdressing salons have been open since that date for anyone who can prove that they are fully vaccinated, have a negative test result less than 72 hours old or contracted Covid within the past two to 12 weeks. That requirement, already lifted from 1 August for some venues such as museums, will disappear for most others from 1 September, although a coronapas will still be needed for nightclubs and large events including football matches until 10 September. The government’s decision not to extend its classification of Covid-19 as a “critical threat” to society beyond 10 September effectively removes the legal basis for the restrictions, a health ministry spokesman said. Restrictions on travel into Denmark, however, will remain in force until at least October because they are covered by a separate agreement between the country’s governing parties that does not expire until a later date."
article48,UK energy firms to assess oil rig security after Nord Stream pipeline leak,2022-09-29 12:17:43,"['Energy industry', 'Oil', 'Oil', 'Oil and gas companies', 'Gas', 'Gas', 'Nord Stream 1 pipeline', 'Nord Stream 2 pipeline', 'Business', 'Commodities', 'Energy', 'Environment', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'Norway']","British authorities are taking “precautionary” steps to ensure UK oil rigs are not vulnerable to interference after drones were spotted near Norwegian rigs and the Nord Stream pipelines were damaged. Executives in the energy industry are coordinating efforts with government agencies to assess security arrangements at offshore and onshore sites, to determine whether any best practices employed in other countries, in particular Norway, should be introduced. If the situation escalates, MI5, the Royal Navy and RAF could be called on to provide support for the industry. The move comes after multiple gas leaks were discovered in the Nord Stream pipelines that connect Russia and Germany, leaving natural gas pouring into the Baltic Sea. Sweden found a new leak on Thursday, the fourth discovery of the week. Nato has said the incidents were “deliberate, reckless and irresponsible acts of sabotage”, while Russia has denied it attacked its own pipelines. On Monday, Norway’s oil safety regulator urged oil companies to be more vigilant over unidentified drones seen flying near Norwegian offshore oil and gas platforms. It warned they could pose a risk of accidents or attacks. The developments have prompted the UK energy industry and officials to review risks to its sites. The trade body Offshore Energy (OEUK) said it was in touch with the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on the matter. The CPNI, a government agency, is tasked with reducing the vulnerability of key UK assets – including nuclear power stations and datacentres – to a variety of threats such as terrorism and sabotage. Mark Wilson, the safety director at OEUK, said the action was “precautionary” and a “proportionate, pragmatic response”. He said there was an aspect of uncertainty after the incidents in Europe, adding: “We are not concerned but we are making sure, should anything come up. There is no evidence of any drones or unusual activities around the areas of concern.” A resilience support group spanning industry, regulators and unions has been in place since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February and will study how best to protect Britain’s 11,000 offshore workers. Offshore rigs typically have a 500-metre exclusion zone into which unauthorised vessels, such as fishing boats, cannot enter. No-fly zones and radar monitoring systems are also used to protect assets. There are also ongoing efforts to protect cybersecurity at energy sites. Vladimir Putin has weaponised energy supplies into Europe since the start of the war, cutting gas flows and triggering concerns about blackouts this winter. Danish and Swedish authorities are reviewing the incidents at the Nord Stream pipelines. Their prime ministers have indicated that the leaks were not accidental. Wilson said the outcome of that review would inform any action in the UK, although it could take days for the gas to drain from the Nord Stream pipelines to allow investigators to fully examine the damage."
article49,‘Fluffy’ crab that wears a sponge as a hat discovered in Western Australia,2022-06-20 08:53:21,"['Australia news', 'Western Australia', 'Animals', 'Oceans', 'Marine life']","A “fluffy” crab discovered off the coast of Western Australia has been named after the ship that carried Charles Darwin around the world. The new species, Lamarckdromia beagle, belongs to the Dromiidae family, commonly known as sponge crabs. Crustaceans in this family fashion and use sea sponges and ascidians – animals including sea squirts – for protection. They trim the creatures using their claws and wear them like hats. Dr Andrew Hosie, a curator of crustacea and worms at the Western Australian Museum, said sponge crabs had hind legs that were specially adapted for holding their protective hats. “The sponge or ascidian just keeps growing and will mould to the shape of the crab’s back,” he said. “It will never attach … it forms a nice cap that fits quite snugly to the top of the crab.” Similar to how hermit crabs use shells for protection, the sponges help Dromiidae crabs to camouflage from predators such as octopuses and other crabs. The sponges can be bigger than the crab itself, and also provide a chemical deterrent. “Some of the compounds that these sponges are producing are very noxious,” Hosie said. “There’s not a lot of active predators that would be interested in munching through a sponge just to get to a crab.” A family living in Denmark, Western Australia found a Lamarckdromia beagle specimen washed up on the beach and sent it to the Western Australian Museum for identification. Hosie and Colin McLay, a marine biologist associated with Canterbury University in New Zealand, then described the crab as a new species – one of three sponge crabs in the Lamarckdromia genus. Comparing the new crab to others in the museum’s collection, they discovered several Lamarckdromia beagle specimens that were previously unidentified or misidentified. The earliest L beagle specimen they found dates from December 1925. Hosie said it wasn’t clear why Lamarckdromia beagle was so fluffy. “The sponge or the ascidian that these things carry should offer it all the camouflage it needs,” he said. “I expect that having the extra fluffy legs means that the outline is even more obscured.” “The hair doesn’t help with holding the sponge down. It’s not like it’s Velcro, unlike some … spider crabs that will put seaweed on their back – their hair is hooked and stiff like Velcro.” The crab’s name commemorates the HMS Beagle, whose second voyage between 1831 and 1836 led to Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection. The ship carried Darwin to King George Sound – the site of Albany on Western Australia’s south coast – in 1836. “Also because it’s tanned, it’s kind of like a beagle colouration,” Hosie said. Lamarckdromia beagle was described with other new species in a paper published in the journal Zootaxa, which detailed 31 species of sponge crab known to be found in Western Australian waters. “Discovering new species in Western Australia is not an unusual thing,” Hosie said. “The amount of things we don’t know we’ve got in Australian waters is still very high.”"

The morning after a 2-0 defeat by Germany and Spain were trying to process something they had not experienced for a long time: 1,114 days had passed since they had last been beaten. Now they have to ensure it doesn’t happen again against Denmark. One loss in three years can be overcome; two in four days would be a disaster, the end of their Euros. A draw on Saturday against Denmark would be enough to take Spain through, although it will be England who await. History had beckoned on Tuesday and defeat hit hard. “We were really gutted; it wasn’t the result we wanted,” Leila Ouahabi said. “But we knew it could happen. Now we have to turn the page and think about Denmark.” Losing to Germany, who they have never beaten at senior level, was always a possibility. And if the way it happened hurt, the flaws familiar, it also offers comfort. That, at least, was what Spain held on to. “On the one hand there is the play; on the other there is the result,” the coach, Jorge Vilda, said. The goalkeeper Sandra Paños hit a pass straight to Klara Bühl to open the scoring after three minutes – the second game in a row in which they had conceded early, having gone behind after 49 seconds against Finland – and Alexandra Popp headed a second from a corner before half-time. Spain had 66% possession but were unable to score. Germany’s coach, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, had said before the game that it would be a clash of footballing cultures; after, she laughed when it was put to her that what unfolded was more extreme than even she had imagined. “Exactly,” she said. The debate around Spain is inevitable, ready to be revived after a defeat: theories about whether they lack a Plan B or a striker – as the final minutes played out, Vilda did not introduce Esther González or Amaiur Sarriegi, their natural No 9s – whether there is a vulnerability about them, a lack of nastiness, edge, or physicality, and the wisdom of playing out. But this is the first time they had lost since March 2019, since when they had won 20 of 24 games, scored 113 and conceded four. They are missing their two top scorers and arguably two of the best players in the world, Jenni Hermoso and Alexia Putellas. And it is a debate that is largely on the outside. There was support for Paños – “a great goalkeeper in whom we have total trust,” Ouahabi called her – and a determination for her to keep playing as she does. After all Spain had twice as many chances and attacks as Germany. Voss-Tecklenburg showed an appreciation for Spain in her analysis and perhaps a lesson for future opponents too. Germany had changed their approach because of the quality of the selección. There had been two options: press high, which she admitted they could not do for 90 minutes, or defend deep. The opening goal, partly prompted by the former, allowed them to switch to the latter with a lead to protect, moving to a 4-5-1. “The plan was also to score from dead balls: we have trained all of that for weeks,” she said. “We were willing to suffer. We found the right tools against the right team.” Spain’s tools do not change, even if mistakes will be addressed. “Could there be changes tomorrow? There could be changes,” Vilda said, but he added: “Spain is Spain. We can prepare games with different elements but our play is recognisable.” Ouahabi, asked whether defeat meant Spain were no longer favourites, responded: “We’re the same people we always were. “I don’t think that defensively we suffered excessively,” the full-back added. “There were errors that were punished but the team was OK defensively. Every team has its strong points. Germany are very good from dead balls. They were effective, and that’s that. We have to focus on our strengths. Maybe we have to be a bit more effective with our chances. You’re competing against teams of the highest level. “What we have to do is play our way, believe in ourselves, be strong. We have to take this forward, think about Denmark. People talk and talk but we’ll support each other. There’s always criticism, but we’ll sort this out. Trust us, support us. Reproach and criticism won’t take us anywhere; we have to all pull together. No one should give us up for dead.” • This article was amended on 25 July 2022. Spain’s previous defeat was 1,114 days before their loss to Germany, not 1,221 days as the text and caption of a previous version said."

Clarke, who named a 26-man squad, has only 16 outfield players and three goalkeepers available for an already testing tie in Copenhagen. John McGinn, Nathan Patterson, Stephen O’Donnell and the new assistant coach, Austin MacPhee, have remained at home for Covid-related reasons. Jack Hendry, who plays in Belgium, has travelled direct to Denmark because of testing protocols. Scott McTominay, Kevin Nisbet, Greg Taylor, James Forrest and Stuart Armstrong are injured. Clarke, though, has pointed towards a bigger picture. “I don’t really want to make too big a thing about it because people are dying of Covid all over the world,” the manager said. “There are people on ventilators and family life is being disrupted left, right and centre. “The team we have on the pitch will be a really good team and the players we have on the bench are really good players. I don’t want to make it a big drama about Covid issues and losing players for a game because people are losing their lives over this. “My daughter has been suffering from long Covid since January, so I understand that people are suffering with this disease. So let’s not go too far down the road of ‘poor us’.” Clarke, who finds himself without a right-back, does feel Uefa needs to look at the timing of competitive internationals. “One of the biggest issues in terms of getting players and getting replacements into the squad was the timescale between getting the squad together on Sunday night and the game being on the Wednesday,” he said. “If the game had been on the Thursday, that extra 24 hours is absolutely invaluable in terms of readjusting your squad a little bit. So there’s a little bit of help that could be had from the authorities in terms of scheduling. “I think people scheduling the fixtures need to have a little think about when the transfer window deadline is and try to separate it a little from the internationals, especially on top of the Covid issues and then you get your normal injury issues. We’ve been hit by all three going into this camp.”Clarke has typically deployed a three- or five-man defence, but Scotland may switch to a back four. It is not lost on Clarke that Scotland once made a habit of upsetting the odds. “Historically, that’s always been us,” he said. “We’ve always sort of been the ones where you like to be the underdog, have things go against you and then stand up and show everyone what we can do.”"

article53,UK in diplomatic standoff over deletion of abortion rights from gender statement,2022-07-28 13:34:41,"['Global development', ""Women's rights and gender equality"", 'Reproductive rights', 'Reproductive rights', 'Politics', 'Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office', 'Society', 'UK news', 'World news']","The UK government is in a diplomatic standoff with three European countries over a statement on gender equality that it changed to remove commitments to women’s reproductive and sexual health rights. Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands are refusing to sign the edited version unless their concerns “are taken into consideration”, a spokesperson for the Dutch foreign ministry told the Guardian on Thursday. The countries have drawn up alternative phrasing and circulated their suggestions among all governments who participated in the international ministerial conference on freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) that took place in London at the start of July. “Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands will not sign the current amended version unless our concerns on the inclusion of [sexual and reproductive health and rights] are taken into consideration, and have yesterday delivered counterproposals to that effect,” the spokesperson said in a statement. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), under whose auspices the conference was held, initially said the edits were made to clear up “a perceived ambiguity”, but has since said it made the changes in order to focus on “core issues and ensure consensus between signatories”. However, the second version of the statement, which was put online days after the conference had wrapped up, has just eight signatories, including the UK, whereas the original version had 22. The original version included a commitment to the repeal of any laws that “allow harmful practices, or restrict women’s and girls’ … sexual and reproductive health and rights, bodily autonomy”. The changes, as well as the opaque way they were made, have also drawn fire from human rights organisations and senior politicians. Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities select committee, has written to foreign secretary and Tory leadership contender Liz Truss asking her to explain “this sudden backtracking on women’s rights”. Labour’s shadow international development secretary, Preet Kaur Gill, described the amended statement as “yet another attack on humanitarian rights from a government whose global reputation has already been tarnished”. Ed Brown, secretary-general of the Stefanus Alliance International (Saint), a religious freedom and human rights organisation based in Oslo, worked on the drafting of the original statement with colleagues from Denmark. He said he would have understood if the concerns had been raised earlier, allowing all parties to come to a mutually satisfactory compromise. But the way in which the changes had been made by the UK after the conference was a big problem, he added. “For me the procedural issue – where the statement is removed after 22 countries have signed it – that for me is a big, big issue and for me undermines the trust that’s been built between nation states on this … That’s my major gripe.” It remains unclear who ordered the changes. The UK hosted the conference in its capacity as this year’s chair of the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance. Fiona Bruce, the Tory MP and prime minister’s special envoy on FoRB, was heavily involved in organising the two-day event. An FCDO spokesperson said: “The UK is committed to defending universal access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health rights and will continue working with other countries to protect gender equality in international agreements.” Bruce has been approached for comment."
article54,Euro 2020: England v Denmark buildup – as it happened,2021-07-07 16:35:22,"['Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Denmark', 'England', 'Spain', 'Italy']","... and with that, my friends, the live baton is passed to your friend and mine, Paul Doyle. He’s preparing to take you on a journey. Whatever happens, it’ll be a journey. Good luck to England, good luck to Denmark, may the best team win the right to pen a fairytale for the ages. Thanks for reading! The Fan Zone in Trafalgar Square. The calm before the storm. Some expectation management, in the form of a lovely email from Martinho Lucas Pires. “As a Portuguese citizen, my only comfort in the days after our loss against Belgium has been to enjoy the amazing energy of the knock-out stages, and the brilliance of the Guardian’s daily updates and reports (yes, I’m an overseas fan). After seeing the It’s Coming Home fever and how it is rising in the UK, I’ll play a bit the party-cracker by saying … watch out. “I was there in 2004 when we put our flags on the windows and adopted the team to our hearts and souls, just to see our dreams crushed at home (at my Benfica’s stadium, of all places). In 2016 all of France was siding with their likely host winners when our team made history with a goal from the most unlikely of players (2004 was suddenly wiped out from all Portuguese collective memory) and basically shattered the home team’s dreams. “You are playing at Wembley, semi-final and final, against Denmark (the coolest of underdogs) and, if you pass, against Italy (the winners of winners). And you’re England, and you are already home. Best of luck mate, but fill the freezer with some pints. You’ll need them: either for good, or for bad.” “What happens when three hijabis walk into a bar?” Shaista Aziz on a tweet that went viral, and why Gareth Southgate’s inclusive England team is winning so many hearts. “As a Northumbrian I also pronounce home hjem,” writers Bill Bevan. “But, I’ll try not to tonight. We do have our own version of hygge, of course. It’s all ganning canny!” Choose your own adventure ... with Adrian Chiles. Hvorfor aye mand. Jimmy worries: “Regarding that great Tweet by the Danish FA (12.40pm) and more specifically the It’s Coming Hjem (*Hjem = Danish for Home) ... as a Geordie, have I been accidentally supporting Denmark all this time?” Hair are your aerials. The good doctor. Somebody had to do it. As if going out in the semis wasn’t upsetting enough, today’s Knowledge asks ... From proper fans to politicians. Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer have been yammering on in support of England. You know the sort of thing they do, there’s probably no need to click. Although Starmer does say that “there’s been only one song featured in our house since Saturday … It’s Coming Home!” which is the most suspiciously disingenuous sounding music-based quote from a Labour leader since Gordon Brown insisted he was a fan of Arctic Monkeys. A decent range of retro shirts on display down Wembley Park Boulevard. Denmark’s classic Hummel effort from the mid 1980s, the Euro 96 job, the most egregious and yet somehow also the best number from the Admiral years, and a red t-shirt that sort of references the 1966 World Cup final. A good effort, all told, plus a full ten out of ten for their tinnies game. Fully stocked up for the next couple of hours at least. Luke Shaw or Joakim Mæhle? Which marauding full back is best? There’s only one way to find out, and it’s not a fight. More breathless stuff from Gary Neville, who will tucker himself out before kick-off at this rate. “History beckons for this team. To reach back-to-back Semi-Finals is incredible, but it’s not enough. You become nearly men! The only danger is that the lads don’t see the danger. When you’re euphoric and on a wave in sport or life you can have that feeling it’s never going to end and something becomes your right. It doesn’t work like that. Go for it lads! Focus and grab this chance!” “Tonight is a night to be cold, don’t let emotion take over.” It sounds like a lyric from one of K-Tel’s Country Classic cassettes. Perhaps sung by Charley Pride or Conway Twitty. But in fact it’s Gary Neville letting it all pour out on Instagram. He adds: “These are young men who haven’t got massive life experience. I’ve been there as a 21-year-old in Euro 96, all of a sudden it’s gone! You’re packing your bags at 1am. Don’t be driving home at 1am in the morning!” [slow pedal steel guitar solo to fade] “K-Tel! Thank you for the memories.” You’re welcome, Charles Antaki. “I don’t recall that particular LP to mind, but many others, as I used to work in a record shop as a youngster. It was in fact part of the EMI factory shop for workers at the plant, so we didn’t stock much hip stuff; big sellers were James Last and Jim Reeves (not together, I don’t think). Regularly as clockwork, after a big K-Tel push on the TV, people would come in wanting Pop Classics Now! or Sounds of Connemara!, or whatever, only to go away disappointed and disgusted to be reminded that they were, as it very insistently said in the adverts, Not Available In Shops.” Actual football, then. Here’s Nicky Bandini on Jorginho, whose preposterously calm penalty sent Italy into the final. Three Lions isn’t the most rousing official England track, of course. That would be The Road to Spain, a narration by Ray Clemence on the 1982 K-Tel album This Time, which culminates in the Churchillian call to arms: “I know that we didn’t qualify in the way we would have liked, but hopefully that’s in the past.” World in Motion was pretty good too, mind, and on that subject, here’s Dan Hampson of Omega Auctions, who has been clearing out Peter Hook’s loft by the look and sound of it. “This is one to file under deep cuts. We’ve just published a few snippets of never-before-heard raps from the ‘World In Motion’ sessions, including a simply stunning effort (really) from Peter Beardsley. We’re on our umpteenth-hundred listen here - it gets better every time. Loads of amazing stuff in the sale but none as important as this one.” (More musings on This Time: The Album here, for those who need them.) Worrying scenes as the dog situation in Feltham threatens to spiral out of control. Bruno and his friends are running amok. This poor woman must have a Snausages bill as long as her arm. It’s not technically a Euros story, but poor old Trent Alexander-Arnold deserves a mention after missing out on England’s summer of fun, doesn’t he, so here we go. Oakley Cannonier, the ball boy who was praised for his quick thinking in tossing the ball to the Liverpool defender ahead of that quickly-taken corner against Barcelona, has signed a professional deal with the club. The 17-year-old striker seems to have a taste for historical footnotes: Cannonier also scored the very last goal at the club’s old Melwood training ground, in an under-18s game against Leeds. Dogs in Feltham latest. Bruno’s still in the back, last we heard. This one’s out here. A deep cut now, courtesy of New York based crate-digger Victor Ortega. “I don’t really know what they are singing about except RED and WHITE,” he says. “Aggressive synths.” Ah, well, I can field this, courtesy of the aforementioned essential tome Danish Dynamite, by Rob Smyth, Lars Eriksen and Mike Gibbons. It’s Denmark’s 1986 World Cup single, with PSV and Denmark midfielder Frank Arnesen on lead vox. This became the fastest and biggest selling single in Danish history. The chorus goes: “We are red, we are white, we stand together side by side.” The comedian Jarl Friis-Mikkelsen, who penned the lyrics, wanted to record a B-side to be sung after defeats, but the DBU nixed his rewrite: “We are red, we are white, we are really deep in shite.” Now that would have knocked Three Lions into a cocked hat. Time to delve into the Joy of Six archive. That should kill an hour or two. Here are a couple to be getting on with, both featuring plenty of hot Danish action. In fact, if you were to draw a Venn diagram featuring sets of hygge and retro soccer whimsy, these articles would be slap-bang in the middle. Spotted earlier today in Feltham, home of a thousand punchlines, as football fever sweeps the land ... it’s Bruno the dog! How, wonders Bruno, to tell his owner that, truth be told, he’s not into Big Sport, taking a much more internationalist approach to life, believing that nation states should cooperate rather than lock horns? Probably best to keep quiet, don’t want to upset them, plus they might cut off the supply of Snausages. Nine months are a long time in football, right? England and Harry Maguire will certainly hope so. “I‘ve been thinking a lot about the Lightning Seeds these past couple of weeks,” admits Beth from Tottenham. “They were a decent little band, but not massively well known. Surely not in a million years would they have thought Three Lions would take off the way it has. Do you know the situation with royalties? Cos if they got a penny for every time someone yelled ‘it’s coming home’, they’d be stinking rich!” No idea about the amount of coin Ian Broudie has trousered, though during the 90s he’d have surely been on a decent BBC stipend for repeated use of earlier hit The Life of Riley, which for a while doubled as the existential soundtrack to Matt Le Tissier’s every move. Today’s Fiver. Yet another tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Speaking of the old World Cup, here are the latest odds for next winter in Qatar. 6-1: Brazil, France 8-1: England 10-1: Spain 12-1: Argentina, Germany, Belgium 16-1: Italy, Portugal, Netherlands 40-1: Colombia, Uruguay You can get 400-1 on Wales, 500-1 on the Republic of Ireland, and a cool 1,000-1 on Northern Ireland and Scotland. Qatar are 200s. The Spanish are sanguine after last night’s bittersweet defeat, as Eric Garcia explains. “We have to think this can be the start of something great. We got this far, we’ve seen other sides who are stronger than us on paper and fell before us. There were many changes, many new faces but what we’ve done is spectacular.” Jordi Alba, still recovering from having his jowls entertainingly warmed by Giorgio Chiellini before the penalty shootout, adds: “We showed that this team is ready for the World Cup. We’ll see what happens in the World Cup as there’ll be great sides such as Argentina and Brazil but we’ll be fighting and looking to play a big role.” There will be 8,000 Danes at Wembley cheering their lads on this evening; Julie Rosendal emails us from Denmark with the details: “Though Danes can’t travel to Wembley to cheer the Danish team on due to C-19, there’ll be 8,000 expat Danes filling the area behind one of the goals. The Danish FA has been actively drumming up expats in the UK, and they’re calling themselves #TheExpatArmy. There’s more info here at the Director and Head of Commercial at Danish FA’s twitter (translation below): Translation of tweet: Everything is now sold out in the Danish sections! 8,000 Danes living in the UK has bought a ticket for the match tonight. We’re completely blown away and this surpasses everything we could have hoped for. Some has named themselves #TheExpatArmy. I salute you! It’s coming hjem*! (*Hjem = Danish for Home) #TheExpatArmy #ItsComingHjem Rah rah rah! all best from Julie Rosendal, a Dane in DK. As for Italy, already in the final, here are a few more words from boss Roberto Mancini, yet to swing the boots up on the desk, pop a cigar on, and get stuck into the grappa. “We haven’t done everything we need to. There’s still one step to go. Now we have to rest up because this really was very challenging. We certainly struggled with Spain’s ball possession, had some issues, but we wanted to make the final. I did say to the players before the match this would be our hardest game of the competition, because when you go into your sixth match in such quick succession with all the travelling that we’ve had to do, it does become very tiring. I thank the players because they believed right from day one that we could create something incredible.” Let’s not get too fixated on England, though. Other teams (well, two remain) are available. Danish Dynamite, huh? Any old excuse. How about a bit more on the aforementioned parping disgrace at Clarence House, where renditions of Sweet Caroline and Three Lions filled the sweet summer air yesterday afternoon? The Prince of Wales invited the Band of the Coldstream Guards onto his lawn to play instrumental versions of the hits, the former written by Neil Diamond, the latter with lyrics by popular 1990s comics Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis (subs, please check). Exactly why, we’ll never know, because he was away with the Duchess of Cornwall carrying out engagements, but this is how the world works now. A royal source says: “Both Their Royal Highnesses will be closely following the outcome.” Hello everyone ... and many thanks to Will, for the mother of all hospital passes. Now then, what shall we do all afternoon while we wait for the MBM? That is all from me today. The good news is that Scott Murray is taking over and he has loads of interesting things to say. Roll up, roll up. “Because this is not just another game,” quotes Paul Roome from Sean Boiling at 1131. “This is the only time they will play in a semi final of a major tournament at home. It will never happen again in their careers.” “Does playing at home make much of a difference to the match? Does Sean really think that winning the Euros at Wembley is sufficiently bigger than e.g. beating the Brazilians at the Maracana in the WC Final that it will add an extra dose of nerves? “They’re professional footballers. They get out there and play. If they don’t/can’t then they shouldn’t be at the top level.” Players will tell you that playing in front of home fans does make a big difference, especially after a long time without supporters. This is a very British approach to getting the country up for the big match. Premier League star Callum Hudson-Odoi has avoided a driving ban after explaining he was running late for training when he was caught going at 90mph in a 50mph zone. The Chelsea winger, 20, admitted speeding in his black Mercedes on August 6 last year on the A3 in south-west London. Prosecutor Alison Larkin said Hudson-Odoi, who had three points on his licence from a previous speeding matter, was clocked driving at 90mph on a 50mph restricted road at 9.47am. Top QC Oliver Glasgow, defending, referred to a letter his client had written to the court explaining he was “under considerable pressure from work” and experiencing “personal problems in his life”. “On his journey to work that day there was a road closure,” he said. “He was expected to arrive at training at a certain time and fearing he would not, he chose to increase his speed. “It was a foolish and stupid decision on his behalf. The personal circumstances in his life and in particular the pressure of work led him to make a very silly decision in attempting to get to work on time,” the barrister added. “What he did was an extremely stupid decision.” Hudson-Odoi could have faced a driving ban but magistrate Gilles Casse ordered him to pay a total of £834, including a £667 fine and costs, and endorsed his licence with six points. Italy are not worrying about who they will face in the final, says Federico Chiesa. “We need to simply think about ourselves just as we have done so far this tournament, that is what has got us this far,” he said. “We need to think about what we need to do there out on the pitch and only after Wednesday will we think about what is next. “Denmark really play with a lot of intensity and throughout this tournament they have really proved what a top side they are and they have some quality players. “England have really shown that their individual players can be matchwinners, they have got some top players in the final third and all across the pitch. We will enjoy the second semi-final and see who we are up against.” There is a cracking episode of Inspector Morse on ITV3 at the moment. Will this be the best thing ITV show today? “Sorry for the long email, but we’ve got plenty of time before kick-off,” Sean Boiling begins (do not worry, the longer the email the less I have to think of something to write myself). “The little bit of sports psychology I’m aware of says that the culture/mindset of ‘it’s just another game’ is the way to get peak performance. That three foot putt to win the Masters is the exact same three foot putt you’ve practised countless times - in fact your skill, preparation, muscle memory, technique etc means that you could hit the putt with your eyes closed. Awareness of the outside context will only hamper your performance. “So, that said … how does the England team, Gareth, his staff, the players deal with that today? “Because this is not just another game. This is the only time they will play in a semi final of a major tournament at home. It will never happen again in their careers. Even Jude Bellingham. What does Gareth say to the players? How do you as a player put the context aside? At the same time as all of those other things that players say about feeding off the crowd and using Wembley to their advantage etc …” Couple of cans to relax themselves and then straight into the Danes, I suspect. Jonathan Wilson’s big brain looks at tactical matters. Who will be the third forward tonight? I reckon Southgate will play a back three and he likes to keep the opposition guessing, so I wonder if Phil Foden will be starting. “We have so much talent and when you train against these players every day … when you get on the pitch against the opposition, because the players we’ve got are world class, you are ready,” Trippier says. “When you train against these guys every day there are no fears.” Where there are winners, there are also losers. Matthias Dressler-Bredsdoff emails re 10.20: “Just to let you know that the expression “over stok og sten” does in fact make perfect sense: in Denmark, particularly in the country-side, there’s a lot of timber-frame houses, called bindingsværkshuse. The expression “over stok og sten” refers to a practice of painting them very quickly i.e not minding whether you paint the frame or the stone (stok og sten).” I know it makes sense but cannot see it catching on in England. I believe this is also a pun. According to the source of all my journalistic materials, Wikipedia: “Hygge is a Danish and Norwegian word for a mood of coziness and comfortable conviviality with feelings of wellness and contentment. As a cultural category with its sets of associated practices hygge has more or less the same meanings in Danish and Norwegian, but the notion is more central in Denmark than in Norway.” Are Denmark underdogs tonight? Yes ... unless you ask their coach. It’s all been worth it just for this. Although, is Atomic Kitten without Kerry Katona the real deal? Kasper Schmeichel is a good sort. Three at the back Always Possibly/to some extent Will be on the ball for 55% of the time it is in play I think I have solved all of the world’s problems with those answers. Real-life Danish person Lars Bøgegaard emails: “Just for the objective balance in the blog (see 9.34): An old Danish saying “Det går over stok og sten” means that something is going really, really fast. Directly translated (which makes absolutely no sense in English, but wait for it…): “It goes over kane and stones.’” You’re quite right, it makes no sense. And then one night in Rome ... “For tonight’s game, as has been the case for every knockout England game, my wife has made plans to go out for dinner,” emails Karl Gibbons. “If … if England win, then for the final on Sunday, she will have to make plans or I shall kick her out to walk the roads for 90 minutes. I will message her score updates – I am not that mean!” She is a lucky, lucky woman. Lovely stuff. Who are Steve O’Brien, Daniel Parker and Dr Benjamin Rosenblatt? I hear you ask. Sachin Nakrani has the answer. Former England manager Roy Hodgson believes Gareth Southgate’s side have been “absolutely perfect” during Euro 2020. Hodgson, 73, who spent four years in charge of the national team until 2016, said he expected England to beat Denmark in Wednesday night’s semi-final at Wembley. “I’m very confident indeed because I think the England team is playing so exceptionally well from the start of the tournament really,” he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “In fact, they have been faultless. I can’t think of anything to criticise, although I’m sure there are people who do find something. But they must be hard pushed to find something. It’s been absolutely perfect.” England know plenty about semi-finals, less so about finals. Andy Hunter takes a look back at the Three Lions’ history in the last four. “Can England bring home the Danish bacon?” asks Ladka Lal. “If Shaw continues to slice through their defence like a knife through Lurpak then England are bringing home to Gareth Southgate’s Lego House that is Wembley. “The boy from Brent, borne of poverty but worth his weight in gold, the kind of North London whose more than able and the boy called Bruce but now a globetrotter. Sterling, Kane, Shaw, it’s ours you know?” No more Danish puns, please, people. IT’S COMING HOME! Now do classical gas. Luis Enrique is taking the positives out of last night’s defeat to Italy. “It’s not a sad night for me,” the Spanish manager said. “Not at all. Of course there’s disappointment but that’s elite football. You have to be able to win and lose. “We were very pleased to win the penalty shootout in the quarter-finals but we can’t get desperate now. We have to just congratulate our opponents. You’re always thinking about the present, thinking about being competitive. “I said at the start we were one of the eight teams that could have won it. I don’t think I was wrong about that. I think we now go home knowing we competed and were one of the best teams at the competition.” Darrell Jones emails to say: “Very concerned about the picture you just posted of the England team doing star jumps. It appears to show a woeful lack of coordination. This does not bode well. :-)” Could be a unique plan to defend corners by bemusing the opposition. Denmark might be seen as underdogs but they do have a Euros title under their belt. Italy will have an extra day of rest compared to the victors tonight. Roberto Mancini will want his players to use it wisely after a tough 120 minutes against Spain. “First and foremost, we’re delighted to have been able to provide this wonderful evening’s entertainment to the Italian people,” the former Manchester City boss said. “Now we still have one more game to go and we wanted to do exactly that if possible. We knew it was going to be a very tough match because in terms of ball possession Spain are the best around. They caused us problems. We had to dig in when we needed to. We tried to score or create opportunities when we could. “It was a very open match and of course there were some issues because we did not have too much possession. However, we wanted to make it into the final and we kept trying right until the end.As ever, penalties are a lottery but I really want to take my hat off to Spain. They’re a wonderful team.” Coming in your ears. I mainly want England to win the tournament so I never have to hear the question “is football coming home?” ever again. The reporter on BBC is just shouting at poor children asking the big question. Another reporter is forcing young kids to sing at a Danish school. Every cliche of news reporting is being ticked off this morning. “Let’s face it, Wembley has always carried its own kind of voodoo, torn at times between the anti-energy of those midweek friendlies when the national stadium carries all the fierce, scalding passion of a night at the Ideal Home Exhibition and the quiet creep of hostility that was present during the tedious 0-0 against Scotland.” The former Denmark coach Åge Hareide just told BBC Breakfast he wants the game to go to penalties tonight, thinking Kasper Schmeichel could be the hero for the Danes. You will be shocked to hear that David James is backing England to get through. After all the talk, Harry Kane has called on England to make their point on the pitch as they look to reach the Euro 2020 final. “It’s a chance to go out there and prove it, we can talk as much as we want but the bottom line is we have to go out there and perform,” said the striker. “We can go and be free, enjoy it, but have a real focus on trying to get through to the final. “Whenever you are an England player stepping out into a major tournament every game is a high-pressure situation. I spoke after the Germany game about the pressure that was on us as a team to perform. We came through that well and, the further you go, we were expected to win the Ukraine game. But you still have to go out there and perform under that pressure. It’s part and parcel of major tournament football. “A lot of us have been dealing with it at club level, Champions League finals, cup finals, so the squad is more experienced than what it was in 2018. It’s about performing on the matchdays, there’s a lot of talk going into this semi-final and it’s a chance for us to go one step further than we did in Russia in 2018.” The bigger question is on a night like this: what are your superstitions ahead of a big match? Do you eat the same meal every time? Wear the same underwear or socks? Do you watch from a specific chair? Let me now. Here is plenty of things to get you in the mood for the next 11 and a half hours. Karen Carney on Raheem Sterling ... Ames on Kane ... Southgate keen on making history ... The morning news has been heavily focused on the England game tonight. Poor journalists turning up outside Wembley at 6am for a match that kicks off at 8pm. There is certainly no shortage of hype around and will be looking to add plenty. Let’s start with last night ... Match report ... Mancini’s delight ... Barney Ronay on Italy’s grit ... And player ratings ... The big day is finally here for England fans, as Denmark await tonight. Between now and then social media will be awash with claims of soccer returning to its abode and discussions about three or four at the back. How will we all maintain calm? Whoever wins tonight will play Italy on Sunday, after they defeated Spain on penalties on Tuesday. What a night it was at Wembley. There was plenty to enjoy, from questionable goalkeeping to fine finishes. Few want a semi-final to be settled on penalties but it gave the dramatic ending the match merited. Roberto Mancini will be watching closely tonight as he plots a trophy lift. Playing at home could be a great advantage for England who are yet to concede a goal in the tournament. There should be plenty of reaction and previews to get our teeth into throughout the day."
article55,European roundup: Midtjylland thrash Lazio and West Ham hold on to win,2022-09-15 22:07:03,"['Europa League', 'Europa Conference League', 'Lazio', 'Feyenoord', 'West Ham United', 'Hearts', 'Sport', 'Football', 'Midtjylland', 'Olympiakos', 'Freiburg', 'Real Sociedad', 'Ferencvaros']","Lazio suffered a humiliating 5-1 defeat at Midtjylland on a night of goals in Europa League Group F. Paulinho opened the scoring and Sory Kaba, Evander, Gustav Isaksen and Erik Sviatchenko were all on target for the rampant Danish side. It could have been even worse for the Italians with Midtjylland also missing a penalty. Feyenoord surged to the top of Group F after registering their first points in emphatic fashion, crushing Sturm Graz 6-0. The Iranian forward Alireza Jahanbakhsh scored twice in the Dutch side’s romp to leave all four clubs with three points. Olympiakos’s hopes of progressing from Group G already look slim, however, as the former Champions League regulars went down 3-0 at the Bundesliga side Freiburg, for whom Michael Gregoritsch grabbed two as they moved top. In Group E Real Sociedad, who beat Manchester United last week, top the standings on six points after beating Omonia Nicosia 2-1. Ander Guevara gave the Spaniards the lead but the substitute Bruno levelled before the Norwegian striker Alexander Sørloth struck the winner in the 80th minute. In Group H, Ferencvaros moved top with six points thanks to a 1-0 home win over Monaco while the 1991 European champions Red Star Belgrade went down 2-1 at Trabzonspor and remain without a point after two games. In the Europa Conference League Gianluca Scamacca scored a cracker but West Ham made hard work of a 3-2 victory at Danish side Silkeborg. The Italy striker, a £30m summer signing from Sassuolo, scored with a stunning strike in between a penalty from Manuel Lanzini and Craig Dawson’s header. But it was not all plain sailing for David Moyes’s side as, just as they had against Romanian side FCSB a week ago, they conceded the first goal. And they were hanging on for the final 15 minutes after Søren Tengstedt pulled one back before eventually making it two wins from two in Europe this season. Lawrence Shankland’s well-taken penalty sent Hearts on their way to a 2-0 Europa Conference League win over RFS in Latvia. Shankland struck two minutes before half-time and the substitute Alan Forrest netted in stoppage time to kickstart Hearts’ European campaign. Hearts had lost six of their previous seven games, including a 4-0 home defeat by Istanbul Basaksehir in their opening group match, but they were well worth the three points at Skonto Stadium in Riga. Robbie Neilson’s side overcame the loss of Craig Halkett to injury on his comeback to move second in Group A."
article56,England v Denmark: key tactical decisions facing Gareth Southgate,2021-07-05 16:00:03,"['Euro 2020', 'England', 'Denmark', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Gareth Southgate']","To three or not to three? The biggest and most obvious question for Gareth Southgate is whether to stick with the back four that got them through the group and beat Ukraine or, as they did against Germany, switch to a back three. There were two good reasons to make the change against Germany. Their wing-backs had excelled against Portugal and so it made sense to match up shape-for-shape and look to engage them as high up the pitch as possible – a ploy that worked so well the influence of Joshua Kimmich and Robin Gosens was minimal. In addition, given how Kai Havertz drops deep from the forward line, it was useful for a centre-back being able to follow him without the risk of leaving huge holes in the defensive line. Against Ukraine, whose wing-backs had been key to their victory over Sweden, Southgate was far more proactive. Opting for a 4-3-3 (or 4-2-3-1, depending how you want to categorise Mason Mount’s role) left the Ukraine wing-backs essentially playing chicken: push up and they risked leaving Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho untended, sit back and England were almost guaranteed to dominate midfield – and then it turned out Sterling and Sancho had the beating of Oleksandr Karavaev and Vitaliy Mykolenko anyway. Then again, Joakim Mæhle and Jens Stryger Larsen should offer more attacking threat than that pair (it might have been different had Andriy Shevchenko done what he did against Sweden and used Oleksandr Zinchenko at left wing-back.) The decision probably comes down to whether Southgate believes England can dominate midfield sufficiently to play on the front foot. Thomas Delaney and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg are far less likely to pass their way round England than were Toni Kroos and Leon Goretzka (plus Mats Hummels and Matthias Ginter stepping up from centre-back) so that may tip the balance towards the three, but Denmark are a better-organised side than Germany. ’Tis in my memory locked England and Denmark met twice last year in the Nations League: a broadly uneventful 0-0 in Copenhagen and a 1-0 win for Denmark at Wembley, a game defined by Harry Maguire’s 31st-minute red card. At the time, he was seemingly unsettled by his conviction in Greece on charges of aggravated assault, resisting arrest and attempted bribery, against which he is appealing, and both his yellow cards were thoroughly avoidable. The dismissal brought a spell of panic from England, when Kyle Walker was unfortunate to concede a penalty after Jordan Pickford had come flying recklessly off his line. Quite how much can be learned from those games is unclear. Denmark played 4-3-3 in each and looked very reliant on Christian Eriksen for creativity, while England were uninspired with a back three. There’s a good chance the teams will be in the reverse formations this time. And there has been nothing in the tournament so far to suggest Maguire or Pickford is likely to be prone to similar rushes of blood. His sword … seem’d i’ the air to stick Southgate spoke before the Ukraine game of wanting England to regain the threat from set plays that had helped proper them to the World Cup semi-final and they promptly scored with headers from a free kick and a corner. John Stones, who hit the post against Scotland, Maguire and Kane will always pose some kind of threat in the air, but it was notable how comfortable the Danish back three of Simon Kjær, Andreas Christensen and Jannik Vestergaard looked against the Czech Republic, who had previously been a persistent danger in the air. The Czech goal was the result of a low cross and given England will be forced to play wide to bypass the central block of Delaney and Højbjerg that may be something they have to consider. Hover o’er me with your wings If it is a back three, Walker will probably play as the right centre-back with Trippier at wing-back. Assuming Sterling retains his position on the left, that leaves a doubt only about the position on the front right of the attacking trio. If it is a back four, the likelihood is that Southgate will stick with 10 of the 11 that played against Ukraine, with the only question on the right flank. With the back three, there is an option to move Mount to the right, where he played in the second half of the Nations League game against Belgium at Wembley, probably the best 45 minutes England played last year. He may not run beyond Kane as instinctively as other members of the squad, but his defensive qualities could be vital against Mæhle, a right-footed right-back who has been a revelation playing on the wrong side in this tournament. If it’s a back four, Mount will be at the front of midfield, which leaves four options. Phil Foden and Jack Grealish can probably be discounted, at least as starters, because they prefer the left, and Sterling has excelled on that side, linking up well with Luke Shaw. So it could be Sancho, who is quick and would pose defensive problems for Mæhle, or, more likely, Bukayo Saka, assuming he has recovered from the knock sustained in training before the Ukraine game. He offers attacking thrust, dovetails pleasingly with Kalvin Phillips, and has the defensive nous to track Mæhle. That the question is being asked suggests the extent Southgate has changed the mindset. His greatest triumph, perhaps, is to shift the conversation away from notions of a first XI and to more bespoke selections."

A romantic fantasy set in the fairytale kingdom of Babenhausen, Ehrengard will be directed by Bille August, the veteran Danish director of Pelle the Conqueror (which won both the Palme d’Or and Oscar for best foreign language film in 1988) and The Best Intentions (which won August a second Palme d’Or). Margrethe, who ascended to the Danish throne in 1972 and is commander-in-chief of the country’s defence forces, has also had a long career as an artist, including drawing the illustrations for Danish editions of Lord of the Rings, and exhibitions at galleries including the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Ishoj near Copenhagen. She also has screen credits as a production designer on the 2009 fantasy fairy tale The Wild Swans, and a short film adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen in 2000. In a statement, Margrethe said: “Karen Blixen’s stories have always fascinated me, with their aesthetic tales, their imagination and their, to me, image-creating worlds – and I’m very happy to be part of this project. I have tried to interpret Blixen’s fantastic universe in the creation of the decoupages and costumes and I’m looking forward to seeing the tale of Ehrengard come to life in this film.” August added: “The Queen has created the most fantastic decoupages for the occasion, and they will be the dominant feature of the film’s overall scenographic expression. ‘Fantastic’ (in the most literal sense) is our starting point for the film; we wish to use humour and elegance to create a devil-may-care, burlesque, fabulous and autonomous visual universe.” Ehrengard is due for release in 2023."
article58,Dylan Groenewegen enjoys redemption to win stage three of Tour de France,2022-07-03 15:55:12,"['Tour de France', 'Cycling', 'Sport']","A day after the QuickStep rider Fabio Jakobsen completed his long comeback from life-threatening injuries to win stage two of the Tour de France, the rider widely blamed for the infamous crash in the 2020 Tour of Poland, Dylan Groenewegen, had his own moment of redemption, the Team BikeExchange rider winning stage three from Vejle to Sønderborg. As the Tour’s exuberant sojourn in Denmark came to an end, so did the mental torture of Groenewegen, vilified over the Jakobsen crash to the extent that at one point he even needed police protection after receiving death threats. In another chaotic sprint finish, Jakobsen, and overall Tour leader, Wout Van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) fought for supremacy, but neither were in full control of the sprint as the peloton closed on the line and Groenewegen’s speed edged him ahead of Van Aert. Groenewegen’s journey back from his involvement in Jakobsen’s life-threatening crash in the Tour of Poland has been long and tortuous. Plagued by guilt over his role in Jakobsen’s injuries, he doubted that he would ever regain the competitive instincts that had once made him one of the sport’s fastest sprinters. “It was a long way [back],” Groenewegen said after his win. “I want to say thanks to my team, to my family and friends. It’s beautiful. Mentally, but not physically, it was hard [coming back]. This is for my wife and my son.” The 2020 crash in a downhill sprint left Jakobsen in an induced coma, with multiple severe cranial and facial injuries. “I kept losing consciousness, slipping in and out,” he recalled after he recovered. “Every time I thought: ‘This is it, now I am going to die.’ This happened 50 maybe, 100 times. I didn’t die, but it felt like that. These were the longest days of my life.” But although Groenewegen sustained a broken collarbone, his main injuries were mental – he endured post-traumatic stress and at one point spoke of retiring from the sport. The crash, he said, was something that he would “always remember”. Cycling’s leading team managers and riders also rounded on him. “They should throw him in prison,” Jakobsen’s team boss, Patrick Lefevere, said of Groenewegen in the immediate aftermath. The win on Sunday was his first at cycling’s World Tour level for two years, revealing the struggle the Dutchman has had to regain his competitive edge. At the time, Groenewegen said that the 2020 crash would forever be a “black page” in his career. “The consequences were very unfortunate and serious. I am very aware of that and I hope this has been a wise lesson for every sprinter. I follow the news of Fabio’s recovery very closely. I can only hope that one day he will return completely.” Despite attempts to fully reconcile the pair, relations remain fragile, but two years on, both are competing on their best form in the hothouse of the Tour and will clearly be rivals in the sprint stages to come. The stage itself continued the party atmosphere that has followed the Tour around Denmark. Another day of uneventful racing was characterised by a festival atmosphere, but saw little of note, beyond the local hero Magnus Cort (EF Education EasyPost) setting off on another lone sortie to clinch the lead in the King of the Mountains classification, before the convoy transferred to northern France. With the final available mountain points in the bag, Cort was caught by the peloton with 52 kilometres to go and gradually the speed rose, as did the tension. A mass crash at 10 kilometres to go, caused by a pinch point in the road, split the field, but most of the major contenders, racing near the front of the peloton, escaped unscathed. Others, among the Tour’s past illuminati, did lose time, with Chris Froome (Israel-Premier-Tech), Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) and Rigoberto Urán (EF Education EasyPost) among those to lose ground in the overall standings. Expect to see all three veterans in breakaway moves when the peloton reaches the mountains. Up ahead, the sprinters flew into the final kilometre. Although all stayed upright there were the usual recriminations, with former world champion Peter Sagan (TotalEnergies) exchanging harsh words with Van Aert as the pair crossed the line. “I cannot judge, we have a jury for that,” Sagan said of his tangle with his rival. “I am happy that I am still here in one piece.” The race leader Van Aert, meanwhile, headed for the flight to France with a yellow jersey in his suitcase and the souvenir of a hat-trick of second places, after narrowly missing out on winning stages one, two and three. “It’s not funny any more,” Van Aert said although, Sagan or no Sagan, he is likely to make amends soon."
article59,Covid surges across Europe as experts warn not let guard down,2022-06-21 17:59:44,"['Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Portugal', 'France', 'Germany', 'Greece', 'Netherlands', 'Europe', 'World news']","Multiple European countries are experiencing a significant surge in new Covid-19 infections, as experts warn that with almost all restrictions lifted and booster take-up often low, cases could soar throughout the summer leading to more deaths. According to the Our World in Data scientific aggregator, the rolling seven-day average of confirmed new cases per million inhabitants is on the rise in countries including Portugal, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark. Portugal has experienced the most dramatic wave, with infections per million remaining at a seven-day average of 2,043 on Monday – the second highest new case rate in the world, although down somewhat from an early June high of 2,878. In France, the corresponding figure has soared from 224 on 13 June to 920 in the space of a week. “The pandemic is accelerating again, despite the warm weather,” Dr Benjamin Davido, an infectious diseases specialist at the Raymond-Poincaré hospital outside Paris, said. “The new Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 are 10% to 15% more infectious and it’s this that is giving the virus an added kick,” Davido told French radio, adding that in the medium term the situation could become “very tough” in the country’s hospitals. “We are in a very particular situation in which it is vital that we maintain stable immunity through booster shots.” Hospitals could fill up over the summer, he said, unless vulnerable people and those over 60 get a fourth dose as soon as possible. Health expert Dr Damien Mascret told France 2 television that the BA.4 and BA.5 variants had led to significant excess deaths in Portugal, adding that hospital admissions in France were up 27% and intensive care admissions 17% in a week. “The holiday season is about to start, almost all restrictions have been relaxed, things could take off again very fast indeed,” he said. “It’s concerning that only 29% of over-60s have so far got the fourth dose to which they are all entitled.” The seven-day average infection rate per million is lower in Germany, reaching 715 on Monday, but has been climbing steadily since the first week of June when it stood at 324. The federal health minister, Karl Lauterbach, has spoken of a “summer wave” of new cases. “This has unfortunately become a fact,” Lauterbach told the Rheinische Post newspaper last week, adding on Twitter that vulnerable people should get a fourth shot of the vaccine and suggesting masks were a good idea in enclosed spaces. Germany’s BÄK medical association recently urged the government to prepare for an autumn and winter Covid onslaught, calling for extra planning to ensure schools stayed open, vulnerable people were protected and hospitals operated normally. The Berlin government’s expert advisory council has said the country is benefiting from both a “high level of immunity” and variants causing relatively mild symptoms, but warned of a worst-case scenario in which hospitals could overwhelmed. The combination of a more dangerous variant with rapidly waning immunity could pose serious problems, it said in a report, adding that masks indoors and capacity limits at major public events could soon be advisable, along with stricter measures in areas with more serious outbreaks. Greece has also seen its seven-day average of new infections surge, from 377 per million on 13 June to 681 this week. The health ministry said on Monday cases would climb further, but it did not expect an increase in ICU admissions or deaths. In Italy new infections have risen from 354 per million to 549 in the space of a week. ISS, the country’s national institute of health, said cases had climbed for the second week in a row, with the transmission rate rising again to epidemic level. The percentage of infected patients in intensive care units continued to fall, but only one of Italy’s 21 regions is still considered a “low” risk, with 14 classified as “moderate” and the remaining six as “high” owing to the rising number of alerts. Prof Walter Ricciardi, a former president of the institute, told Adnkronos that the government may have relaxed restrictions too quickly. “It’s our third summer (of the pandemic) and we still haven’t learned our lesson,” Ricciardi said. “In the most favourable times for fighting viruses, spring and summer, we cannot let our guard down, and we must also prepare for unfavourable conditions in the autumn, and I don’t think any of this is being done.” Case numbers in the Netherlands have risen for a third week in a row, the Dutch public health institute, RIVM, said on Tuesday, blaming the global rise of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. According to Our World in Data, the Dutch seven-day infection rate has surged from 117 per million to 204 per million in the past week. The two biggest Dutch employers’ organisations called on Monday for people to return to observing basic coronavirus hygiene rules, saying a new wave appeared imminent, while the health minister, Ernst Kuipers, has said there was a “very real” risk of millions of people becoming infected this autumn."
article60,Denmark’s Kasper Hjulmand: ‘It’s been an emotional year. A horror film but also a fairytale’,2022-02-17 13:00:36,"['Denmark', 'Football', 'Sport']","Kasper Hjulmand is in a reflective mood. The past year has been like no other, and the Denmark coach has had to deal with enough emotional drama to last a lifetime. On 12 June 2021, Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch against Finland, his heart stopping before he was resuscitated and taken to hospital. Denmark lost that Euro 2020 group game and no one was thinking about football but somehow they rose from the trauma to reach the semi-finals, where they lost narrowly to England. Last summer had it all: a life-changing moment, fear, euphoria and a nation coming together. As we talk on Teams, Hjulmand speaks eloquently about what he calls a “moment of truth”. What impact have the events at Parken had on you? You find your real identity, what matters in life. You discover why you do things and the true values of football: friendship, support, tolerance, hard work and compassion. Everything that children learn when they play football actually. Football sometimes gets too far removed from that basic identity. Here we were very close to finding that again. It really was a moment of truth. But also of total fear? Of course. It’s the worst you can experience. Losing people you love … And we did, because Christian was really gone for a while. You look at how the staff react, how the players react. This isn’t a team-building drill in the woods with two experts pushing you. This was real. You see your wife, children and parents in the stands. But we couldn’t get to them because of corona[virus]. It was something you learn from. We talk about that a lot. What have you learned? A cliche perhaps, but: living in the now. Do what feels right now. Don’t spend too much time on the past and the future. That is an incredibly valuable lesson. It has made us better, in many ways. But it can also become traumatic? That can certainly happen if you push your emotions away. If you bundle them together, put them in a box and try to lock it. We have said: every emotion is good. If you’re feeling super-sad, that’s OK. If you don’t have that at all, that’s OK too. You may even feel both of those emotions at the same time. It’s important that players and staff can be who they are, that I can be who I am. I also have good and bad things, I also make mistakes. We should not act, but just be ourselves. The players are doing a great job at that. Do you think that process has been accelerated by what happened to Eriksen? We were already on the right track. We have worked hard on that too. But if it hadn’t happened, we would have played even better. We would have unleashed the same enthusiasm about our football and achieved at least as good results, I think. But you never know. When something like that happens it makes you stronger. If you do it right, that is. Otherwise it will indeed be a trauma. But it brought a lot of togetherness. Also with people outside of football. They also became part of this journey. Not just the Danish football fans, but all over Europe. Everywhere I go people ask: “How is Christian?” We have become emotionally connected to the people; everyone now wants to be part of the national team. Women, men, girls, boys. That passion and that support that we feel from the Danish people … that’s what I dreamed of when I started. I had two goals. First, win something. Second, to unite the nation. The power of football is incredible. It’s been a great year, an emotional year. A horror film, but also a fairytale. It was not the first time someone close to you has collapsed on the field. It also happened to Jonathan Richter from Nordsjælland, the team you coached in 2009. He was struck by lightning and was also briefly dead. With Christian we knew pretty quickly that things were going well, with Jonathan it took two months before we knew if he would survive. So I thought about that too, I recognised those emotions. So I had some experience and I used it. The players said you were incredibly empathetic during that period. You helped drag the squad through the tournament and afterwards. Did you have room for your own emotions? I thought I should lead the group. To do the right thing. I thought that was important. But if you want people to talk about emotions, you have to do it yourself. In addition, I had to inform the press and the country about the situation. There was a psychologist with the team during the Euros and I sometimes talk to him. I talk to people at the union and the staff. The match against Finland was eventually resumed. How do you look back on that decision? It was a stupid decision. I wish I had had the courage to tell the players to get on the bus and go back to the hotel. We were given two options: resume or play a day later at noon. No one wanted to go back a day later. So we kept going, but it was crazy to play. The point was: is Christian OK? It looked good at the time. I’d been to the hospital, hugged him and it felt good. That provided an opening to continue. But we shouldn’t have continued. You have known Christian since he was 11. What is he like? He’s a great player but an even greater person. You don’t see many people at that level who always keep their feet on the ground, who are always themselves. His love for football is unbelievable. I’ve never seen him without a ball near him. In addition, he is a very social person, he talks to everyone, whoever you are. I’ve seen so many players “leave earth” when they became successful. That’s why I like him so much. We have great captains. Simon Kjær is a fantastic leader, Kasper Schmeichel is a great expressive captain. If I talk to Christian, it will be about football within two minutes. He is the captain in the rhythm of the game, reading of the game, the feeling of a match. His eyes see everything. That’s how he leads. He is the heart and rhythm of the team. And now he is back in football with Brentford … I am very happy with the steps Christian has taken. He has found something there that he thinks is just right for him. He has played over 200 matches in the Premier League so it is a league he knows and stadiums he knows. He has found a place where he feels confident to take the next step in the fight to get back on to the field. I’m super-happy that Christian is safe and happy and looking forward to playing football, and that we can all see him play football again. You became a Danish champion in your first season with Nordsjælland and moved to Mainz but returned to Denmark to help care for your brother, who is autistic. At the age of four he was a fluent reader and there is no person I know who knows so much about music. Yet he is made passive by the system. At 18 he was put away instead of trying to help him develop his qualities. We don’t just do this with people with disabilities, we do it with everyone. We think we see something, we label that, when there is so much more. Because of him I look at people in a different way. Sometimes people limit themselves by what they have been taught by teachers or parents. As a result, they quickly think: this is not for me. I want to try to remove those boundaries. That is the job of a teacher. Don’t tell us what you can’t do, but show us what you can do. I learned that from my brother. In Denmark you have been called ‘the leader of the nation’ since the European Championship. Does your brother understand what you did? He’s more concerned about smaller things. He likes music so we went to concerts. I try to spend a lot of time with him. If he reads somewhere that I might be going to an English club, he calls or writes: “What am I going to do, where are we spending Christmas?” There have been many offers, including some from England, but you decided to stay with Denmark. Why? I’m still curious about what can be done with Danish football. We play well, get good results, connect people, but we haven’t won anything yet. You can call that a dream, but I like dreams. This article was amended on 18 February 2022 to remove part of a reply in which Kasper Hjulmand referred to his goalkeeper coach being seriously ill. Between the time of the interview, conducted originally for de Volkskrant, and publication the coach, Lars Høgh, died (8 December 2021)."
article61,Christian Eriksen agrees to Manchester United move on three-year contract,2022-07-04 11:34:06,"['Manchester United', 'Christian Eriksen', 'Brentford', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport']","Christian Eriksen has agreed to join Manchester United on a three-year deal after talks with Erik ten Hag. The Denmark midfielder, who spent the final four months of last season at Brentford and is out of contract, has reached a verbal agreement and the move is subject to a medical. Eriksen returned to action in February after his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 eight months earlier and Brentford had hoped to keep him. But the 30-year-old has opted for United and communicated his decision to both clubs on Monday. The former Tottenham player impressed during 10 starts and one substitute appearance for Brentford in the Premier League, scoring once and providing four assists. On Monday United were also close to confirming the signing of the left-back Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord, with the Netherlands international undergoing the final part of his medical. The moves come as Cristiano Ronaldo, who wants to leave Old Trafford, missed his scheduled return to pre-season training for family reasons. Unhappiness over United’s summer transfer business is at the root of the 37-year-old’s desire to move, though United continue to insist he is not for sale. Ten Hag is trying to make several signings in his first window as manager, with Barcelona’s midfielder Frenkie de Jong and the Ajax central defender Lisandro Martínez among other targets. Eriksen spent six and a half seasons with Spurs before joining Internazionale, who released him last December because the rules in Italy do not allow players to compete if they have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator device (ICD). He was fitted with one after his cardiac arrest. Eriksen and Ten Hag spent several years at Ajax, Eriksen as a player until 2013 and Ten Hag as a coach from 2017."
article62,Finland’s win against Denmark overshadowed by Eriksen collapse,2021-06-12 19:37:46,"['Euro 2020', 'Denmark', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Finland']","It was a game that felt simultaneously extraordinarily trivial and hugely significant. When Christian Eriksen collapsed four minutes before half-time, needing CPR on the pitch, it seemed inconceivable – unthinkable – that it could continue. As he lay, limp, surrounded by protective and clearly distressed teammates, there seemed a possibility the tournament might be cancelled. And yet, an hour and 45 minutes later, they were back. The sight of Mathias Jensen coming on for Eriksen was hugely poignant, a mundane act lent profundity by context. The assumption, even as news came through that Eriksen was awake in hospital, was that this game at least would have to be postponed. Yet the players and coaches, after being consulted in the dressing room, agreed to play on. That, in turn, perhaps reflected a wider theme of this tournament. Euro 2020 is still called Euro 2020 largely for reasons of marketing, but playing it 12 months later and resolutely sticking to the original name is also a reminder that the tournament itself is a symbol of resilience. Of course it’s possible, perhaps even correct, cynically to see the constant churn of games as indicative of football’s eternal need to generate revenue, but there is more to it than that. To see fans in a stadium, to sense the expectation, to feel again the thrill of a tournament getting under way has offered a welcome sense of life, at last, beginning to return to normal. The result was one that, under normal circumstances, would have been celebrated as a significant shock, the tournament debutants beating a side widely tipped as possible quarter-finalists in their own stadium. Who knows what the players were thinking as they decided to play on? Who knows what motivated them? Footballers play football; it may be many preferred the idea of simply carrying on, keeping things as normal as possible, rather than dwelling on the horror they had witnessed. Perhaps some saw it as a way of doing right by Eriksen; Romelu Lukaku paid tribute to him after scoring in the other group game. And perhaps some deep-lying recognition that this tournament is all about carrying on, keeping things going, for better or worse, gave additional impetus to the desire to play to the finish. As fans waited after the suspension, they had engaged in a call and response of Eriksen’s name, and Finland’s players applauded Denmark’s back onto the pitch. For Finland, anyway, just being there was an achievement. This was their first ever appearance in a major finals, a giddiness apparent in their smiles and roars as they broke after the anthems. A day that was always going to be memorable for them became unforgettable for a deeply worrying reason. The conclusion of the first half was understandably tepid, four minutes of both sides going through the motions before a brief half-time. After a five-minute break the game took on a more normal dynamic, although everything still felt muted. And then, from nowhere, Finland took the lead, Joel Pohjanpalo heading in Jere Uronen’s left-wing cross. Denmark have become a little more proactive under Kasper Hjulmand, but they remain fundamentally a solid team heavily reliant on Eriksen for creativity. They had dominated the very early stages in which Lukas Hradecky, the Bayer Leverkusen keeper, was a skittish presence, never looking comfortable dealing with aerial balls, although he did make a string of saves. None perhaps was a save that he wouldn’t be expected to make, but there comes a point at which the quantity alone is notable. After a bright start, though, Denmark faded as Finland settled. It was as though the start had been so straightforward, they had allowed themselves to assume the breakthrough would come, and then became impatient and a little ragged when it didn’t. In the final half hour, although they probed, they threatened only rarely. Even when they were granted a generous penalty by the English referee Anthony Taylor, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg’s tentative effort was comfortably saved by Hradecky. Denmark perhaps felt they had to finish the game, but it’s only natural if they were distracted and the other group games, against Belgium and Russia, should give a far truer reflection of their abilities. Finland, dogged and well-organised, should not be begrudged their celebrations, but this was never about the result."
article63,Chelsea’s move for Jules Koundé in danger of collapse as Barcelona push,2022-07-25 13:32:12,"['Chelsea', 'Barcelona', 'Sevilla', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Transfer window']","Chelsea’s move for Jules Koundé is in danger of collapsing, with Barcelona refusing to end their pursuit of the Sevilla defender. It had appeared that Chelsea were set to make Koundé their third summer signing. They were in advanced talks with Sevilla, who have been holding out for £55m, and financial restrictions had left Barcelona on the verge of pulling out of the race for the 23-year-old last Friday. However Barça revived their interest in Koundé over the weekend and are increasingly optimistic they will win the race to sign the France international. The Catalan club, who have already beaten Chelsea to the signing of the Brazil winger Raphinha, have continued to tell Koundé to wait for them to submit their opening offer. It is believed they could end up paying a lower fee than Chelsea. Barça’s persistence has raised fears that Chelsea, who have a five-year deal ready for Koundé, are set to encounter further frustration in their attempts to rebuild their defence. It is understood that Chelsea, who have pursued the centre-back since last summer, are close to giving up and could walk away from negotiations with Sevilla if there is no breakthrough soon. Another complication is Thomas Tuchel is not entirely convinced about signing Koundé. There are doubts over whether the 5ft 10in defender is tall enough to succeed in the Premier League. Tuchel refused to talk about Koundé before Chelsea faced Arsenal in a pre-season friendly in Florida last Saturday. Chelsea’s manager expressed frustration with Barça’s conduct this summer, suggesting he may stop César Azpilicueta from moving to the Camp Nou. Tuchel then gave a fiery press conference after Arsenal beat his side 4-0. The German is understood to be frustrated with Chelsea’s lack of progress in the transfer market. He has seen them miss out on deals for Nathan Aké, Matthijs de Ligt and Raphinha. There has been little progress in talks with Paris Saint-Germain over the France defender Presnel Kimpembe. RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol and Internazionale’s Milan Skriniar are other defensive targets. Chelsea, who have bolstered their attack by signing Raheem Sterling from Manchester City, need to strengthen their defence after losing Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rüdiger on free transfers. They have signed Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli, but Tuchel wants to bring in two more centre-backs. However progress has been slow – Chelsea’s co-owner Todd Boehly has taken charge of recruitment on an interim basis – and Tuchel also made clear that his squad still contains players who wants to leave. There are doubts over the futures of Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso, Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner, who has been linked with a return to RB Leipzig. Levi Colwill, a 19-year-old centre-back, could look to leave if Chelsea make further additions in defence, and Armando Broja has seen a move to West Ham collapse. Everton and Napoli could move for Broja, though Chelsea are prepared to keep the 20-year-old striker. As it stands Chelsea do not appear to be in a strong position before the Premier League starts on 5 August. The club, who visit Everton in their opening game, have experienced huge change since their sale to a consortium fronted by Boehly and Clearlake Capital. An element of chaos was always likely after the end of the Roman Abramovich era and there is still plenty of time for Tuchel to strengthen before the transfer window shuts. Chelsea are monitoring Frenkie de Jong, but the Netherlands midfielder remains reluctant to leave Barça. Tuchel is also in the market for a right wing-back and is looking at Internazionale’s Denzel Dumfries."
article64,Denmark sink Scotland with early blows from Daniel Wass and Joakim Mæhle,2021-09-01 20:53:39,"['World Cup 2022 qualifiers', 'Denmark', 'Scotland', 'World Cup 2022', 'World Cup', 'Football', 'Sport']","Steve Clarke had called it “the most disruptive week going into a camp” and the ramifications were laid bare for Scotland as Denmark continued their comfortable advance towards the World Cup finals. The Euro 2020 semi-finalists had too much craft and energy for a depleted Scotland team, and maintained their 100% qualifying campaign with considerable ease. A visit to the top seed in the group would have been a daunting challenge for Scotland without a raft of absentees or the passionate backing that Denmark received on their first appearance at the Parken Stadium since the European Championship. It unfolded as Clarke might have privately feared when his squad was reduced by eight because of Covid issues and injury but, that said, he also had every reason to lament the passive first-half display that ultimately condemned Scotland to defeat and a desperate fight to finish second. “Let’s not under-estimate how good this Denmark team is,” the Scotland manager said. “They are a good side playing with great confidence, as they showed in the summer. Against the top teams you have to learn to ride out the storm and we didn’t do that.” Without a recognised right-back, Clarke tasked Andy Robertson with a surprising shift at right wing-back. The enforced switch did not pay off, mainly as a consequence of Kieran Tierney’s lapses on the opposite flank, and was abandoned at half-time. By then it was too late. Two goals in the space of 92 seconds in effect settled the contest inside 15 minutes. The opener was galling from Clarke’s perspective. The hosts, greeted by a sold-out crowd and a banner that proclaimed: “You have reunited the nation” after their emotional charge to the Euro semi-finals, targeted the space behind Tierney from the outset. Daniel Wass, the overlapping right-back, almost capitalised twice before punishing Scotland at the third attempt. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg floated a tantalising cross over the left wing-back, who stepped out unnecessarily and allowed Wass to steer a header beyond the recalled Craig Gordon. As Scotland regrouped Denmark struck again. The impressive Andreas Olsen cut in from the right and picked out Joakim Mæhle on the edge of a crowded area. Mæhle flicked the ball out to Mikkel Damsgaard, who chipped an exquisite return to the left-back who scored between Gordon’s legs. At this point, with Gordon denying Yussuf Poulsen after more poor Scotland defending, a rout beckoned. The visitors will take consolation in preventing one. Scotland had no outlet, no threat and could not get near Denmark’s midfielders or Damsgaard as he drifted into space and picked passes at will in the first half. Clarke reacted at the interval, replacing defender Scott McKenna with the in-form QPR forward Lyndon Dykes and restoring Robertson to the left. Tierney stepped inside to the three-man central defence and Ryan Fraser dropped to right wing-back. Improvement was immediate. Billy Gilmour drove just wide from 25 yards and the Danish defence were finally put under pressure with and without the ball. Callum McGregor, Grant Hanley and Fraser all went close, the latter forcing a fine low save from Kasper Schmeichel, but Scotland could find no reward. “We’ve got two massive games coming up now,” said Robertson. “We are still right in it, in my opinion but we need to pick up points. It’s about believing we are a good team, sticking to our gameplan and doing it for 90 minutes, not only 45.”"
article65,Russia 1-4 Denmark: Euro 2020 – as it happened,2021-06-21 21:15:02,"['Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Russia', 'Denmark', 'Football', 'Sport']","Right, that’s it from me. Stick around on site for all the reports and reaction. Thanks for your company and the deluge of emails – apologies for not getting round to them all. And for now, cheerio! Here’s Paul Doyle’s report on an exhilarating night in Copenhagen: There was a fair bit of ale spilled in the celebrations … Stat! Hard not to feel emotional after that. After everything the Denmark squad have been through, with the pressure on in the second half, to produce that performance was pretty special. “Whenever a manager complains about fixture congestion, timing of matches, tiredness, etc all the pundits weigh in saying that you should never give players excuses for under-performing because they’ll take them,” writes David Wall. “But the Danes are giving the lie to that dogma. If any team had an excuse to under-perform it would have been them. Instead they’ve risen to the special challenges thrown up for them, and are going to be rewarded. I’d be worried if i was in the Welsh camp.” It’s not really the story but … The Danish players form a huddle and there’s an official in the middle refreshing his live score app to make sure the full-time whistle has gone in St Petersburg … and once confirmation comes through the party can start. PEEP! PEEEEP! PEEEEEEEEP!!! All over and what an achievement. Denmark are through to the knockout stages to face Wales in Amsterdam. 90 min: Three minutes added on. Three minutes between Denmark and the last 16. 89 min: It feels trite to say they have “bounced back” … but the way Denmark have performed in the two games since that awful afternoon just nine days ago is really quite remarkable. They’ve been brilliant in this second half and you have to hope that Christian Eriksen has been watching and enjoying every minute. The sense of togetherness has been palpable in Parken tonight. 86 min: “I bet I’m not the only Welshman with that sinking feeling,” writes Arwen Jones. 85 min: Delaney is replaced by Jensen. Cornelius is on for Braithwaite. “Brilliant game,” writes Nick Parish. “What’s really impressed me about Denmark is that even when it was 2-1 and they were only one Russian goal away from going out, they didn’t try to defend the game out but kept on attacking. And as a reward their fans can now sing their hearts out for the last 10 minutes instead of biting their fingernails off. Great to see.” 83 min: So only Finland can poop the party now. And Lukaku has just doubled Belgium’s lead. That could be that. I think Denmark might have won this. Russia get caught forward at a set-piece and the left-wing-back is away. He uses his runners by not using them and slots home Denmark’s fourth. What a scoreline. What a goal! What a goal! Saforov made a couple of excellent blocks as Russia found themselves scrambled, but it broke to the Chelsea defender 25 yards out and he thunders – thunders – an exocet of a shot into the roof of the net. 80 min: … and Christensen’s header is brilliantly saved. 79 min: Diveev flicks a Stryger Larsen free-kick wide for a corner … 78 min: As it stands? Denmark are heading to Amsterdam and that meeting with Bale and co. 77 min: More cheers from the stands as news filters through from St Petersburg, a little more restrained this time. But this time Belgium are ahead. 76 min: “Re the Danish fans: they are singing ‘We are red. We are white. We stand together. Side by side,’” writes Thomas Hougaard. “It’s the refrain from the official song for Denmark’s 1986 World Cup campaign (which they should have won, by the way. What a team.) It was/is called Re-Sepp-ten, meaning ‘the recipe’ but spelled wrongly to include the name of then manager Sepp Piontek. Regarding ‘scenes’: It doesn’t translate well. If someone were to say “absolute scenes in Parken” it would be most correct to say “Publikum i Parken går amok.” (The Parken audience goes wild/runs amok). So there you go.” 74 min: A Denmark corner is swung in and Safolov drops the ball in the middle of a circle of eight players. Minor chaos ensues but Russia manage to scramble the ball away. 73 min: Norgaard replaced Damsgaard. 72 min: So Russia, who really should be down to 10 men, are back to being a goal away from the last 16. 70 min: And Belgium are not ahead. Well, that has changed the atmosphere somewhat! The big man makes no mistake. Vestergaard clumsily trips Sobolev in the box and the referee points to the spot! 68 min: The Parken crowd begin to lose its collective mind again as news filters through of a possible Belgian goal … 67 min: Here’s Peter Mortensen on our earlier question on “scenes”: “Scener would be the translations perhaps dependent on precisely what ‘scenes’ means in the English sentence? And the Danish words for a Russian gift/present is ... en russisk gave!” 65 min: The already-booked Kudryashov hauls down Dolberg – the most nailed-on yellow card you’ll ever see – but the referee takes a sympathetic view and lets him off the hook. 64 min: Gorgeous interplay between Braithwaite and Dolberg puts the latter through on goal but his touch is heavy and the chance of goal of the tournament contender goes begging. 62 min: Finland still sit second but a Belgium goal would put Denmark into the box seat. You can follow that one here, by the way: 61 min: The goal brings ch-ch-ch changes. Poulsen goes off to be replaced by Dolberg. Jens Stryger Larsen comes on for Wass. Aleksandr Sobolev replaces Miranchuk for Russia, and Rifat Zhemaletdinov is on for Ozdoev. What on earth? Safonov throws the ball out to the left. Kuzyaev looks upfield but can’t see any options, so goes back to his keeper … but he hasn’t seen Poulsen! The pass is a bad one as well, so the Danish striker has the simplest task of slotting the ball into the empty net. A huge moment. 57 min: Delaney pulls down Zobnin in midfield and picks up a booking. 56 min: Poulsen sees his shot blocked on the edge of the box but you get the sense that Denmark’s trio of attackers are happier now Russia are being forced out of their deep block. 55 min: Parken unites in song, and the effect sounds like something you might hear in a church or temple rather than a football stadium. It’s a fantastic, almost spiritual, cacophony (perhaps helped by the fact that I don’t know what any of it means …) 54 min: Chance? Hojbjerg lofts a lovely pass into the box and Wass looks to be in a fine position to volley at goal but instead looks to square for a teammate and the attack peters out. 53 min: Diveev slides in to deny the charging Poulsen. 51 min: Pass, pass, pass from Denmark. Passpasspasspasspas … hoick from Schmeichel. 50 min: Both are fine to continue. 48 min: Russia have started on the front foot, without creating a great deal. There’s another break in play as Kudryashov clashes heads with Hojbjer and requires treatment. 47 min: He’s soon up though and looks to be fine to continue. 46 min: Maehle has stayed down after tripping Mario Fernandes and looks in a bit of pain. Peep! Off we go again. The players are back out. Here comes part two. As it stands, by the way, Finland are qualifying for the last 16 and a date with Wales in Amsterdam. Peep! PEEEP! Half-time, and Denmark, after a frustrating spell, will be happy enough with that. 45 min: Just the one minute added. 43 min: Russia had twice been close to picking up bookings for time-wasting before that goal – always what might be termed A Bad Look in a first half. They’ll have to pick up the energy levels now. 41 min: “What’s the Danish for ‘scenes’’? wonders Niall Mullen. We almost had more, with Vestergaard nodding just wide from a corner. 40min: That goal produced Proper Noise. Denmark lead! And it’s a superb strike. The ball is zipped into him on the edge of the box, he takes a touch to come inside from the left and sends a beautiful dipping effort into the top corner with his right peg. Cracking goal. 37 min: Damsgaard’s delightfully curving cross for a moment seems to be heading right into Poulsen’s path but Kudryashov is there to head away. 36 min: Maehle gets down the left as Denmark finally mount an attack worth the name. His cross is headed away by a Russian defender, though. 34 min: Golovin smites a shot well over the bar from the edge of the box. 32 min: Denmark seem to be lacking a focal point up front, with Poulsen, Braithwaite and Damsgaard not really offering much thus far. I think we might see Andreas Cornelius or Jonas Wind pretty early in the second half. 29 min: Hojbjerg is inches away from a proper screamer. His effort from 25-odd yards zips just wide of the post, with Saforov at full stretch. That’s as close as Denmark have come so far. 28 min: Further howls as Kudryashov thunders into Wass with the Denmark wing-back rising high for a header. He’s deservedly booked. 27 min: The Parken crowd howls its disproval as Russia take their time at a free-kick. 25 min: Poulsen fouls Ozdoev down by the corner flag. It’s been a good 10 minutes since Denmark created anything resembling an attack. 24 min: Damsgaard wins a free-kick in midfield as Danish frustration builds. 22 min: … which comes to nothing as Kjaer is fouled by Dzhikiya with the ball still en route. 21 min: Another Russia break and it’s suddenly four on three. Zobnin’s pass is toed away by Christensen for a corner … 19 min: Dzyuba wangs an effort wide from Miranchuk’s cross but this has been Russia’s best spell of the game so far. 16 min: The first save of the game, and surprisingly it’s Schmeichel who has made it. Golovin ghosts through midfield with barely a challenge registering and suddenly he is bearing down on goal. He checks past one last defender, though, narrowing his angle and Schmeichel is able to save pretty comfortably with his feet. That was a very decent chance. 14 min: Thunk! Kuzyaev hammers into Poulsen to win the ball. Thunk! Poulsen forcefully takes it back! THUNK! Dzyuba does likewise and concedes a free-kick. 12 min: Damsgaard and Maehle threaten down the left, but Mario Fernandes does very well to keep his head and prevent a cross coming in. As the ball is cleared, Dzyuba wins a free-kick to relieve the pressure a little. 11 min: Wass goes long in search of the surging Delaney, who can’t quite bring the ball under his spell. One-way traffic at the moment, though. 9 min: Braithwaite gets down the right and fizzes in a cross, which is headed behind for a corner … but as it floats towards Christensen at the back post, the referee blows for a free-kick after Diveev tumbles to the turf. 8 min: Out of possession Russia are falling in to something approaching a 5-1-4-0, with even Dzyuba dropping deep. 7 min: Safonov has to charge out of his goal to awkwardly knee a long ball out for a throw in. 5 min: Maehle floats a cross into the Russia box from wide on the left but a Russian head rises to meet it. Denmark beginning to get a grip on the game now. 3 min: A stop in play as Dzyuba – something of a unit, it’s fair to say – clatters into Kjaer. The Denmark captain is soon back up though. 2 min: A scrappy opening couple of exchanges with each team seemingly keen to hand possession to the other. Peep! Off we go then. For the anthems, Denmark were in red training tops, Russia in white. For the game itself Denmark are in white, Russia in red. Both anthems are belted out with considerable gusto by the teams and we’re good to go. Click-clack, click-clack … out come the teams. Parken is a picture. “Schmeichel playing striker in Denmark’s 3-4-4?” asks Paul Pooley. “Or are they gonna play with 12? It happens. I’m a long-suffering, er, long-serving referee and that is why we count players on the pitch before we start or restart a game.” As a ton of you have pointed out, in the teams I had Denmark playing in a revolutionary 3-4-4 formation. Just to clarify, umm, they’re not. With all the potential for mathematical fun this evening, I wandered back through the last few tournaments to see if we’d ever got to the coin-toss stage. Generally it doesn’t happen, though there was this in 2004, coincidentally enough involving Denmark … Russia (3-4-3): Safonov; Diveev, Dzhikiya, Kudryashov; Mario Fernandes, Ozdoez, Zobnin, Kuzyaev; Miranchuk, Dzyuba, Golovin. Denmark (3-4-4): Schmeichel; Christensen, Kjaer, Vestergaard; Wass, Hojbjerg, Delaney, Maehle; Braithwaite, Poulsen, Damsgaard. So Denmark are unchanged from the side against Belgium. For Russia Fyodor Kudryashov replaces Dmitri Barinov. Of course, thoughts in Denmark have understandably not really been on goal difference equations and head-to-head complications. If you missed it on Sunday, the Observer had this wonderful piece from Danish journalist Tom Carstensen on the heroes of Copenhagen, how Eriksen’s life was saved and what it meant for the nation. We are so proud of the players and staff and how they have conducted themselves. The team can still progress but no one really cares about that. We are thinking about what is important: Christian Eriksen is alive. Hello all. So to Copenhagen, where both sides can still reach the knockout stages. Let’s have a look at The Permutations. Russia win! They go through. Denmark are out. Easy that one. A draw! Russia go through in second spot as long as Finland don’t spring a surprise and beat Belgium. Denmark are out. So far, so straightforward Denmark win! Now it gets interesting. Finland would be through in second spot with a draw (or top if they beat Belgium) while the more likely defeat would leave three teams on three points. In that scenario a 1-0 win for Denmark would put the head-to-head table all square on goal difference and goals scored, so the goal difference against Belgium would come back into play – bad news for Russia, but obviously dependent on the Finland-Belgium scoreline. A two-goal win (or more) for Denmark would put them through, while a 2-1 win would also be enough, as would a 3-2 and so on, because that would elevate both these sides above the Finns on goals scored in their head-to-head triumvirate, and then their results against Belgium would come back into play to separate Denmark and Russia. Clear? Good. There’s also the possibility of three teams finishing on six points – if Russia and Finland both win – which would most likely see Russia qualify as one of the best third placed teams, unless Finland absolutely batter Belgium which would mean … ah, let’s just see what happens. Kick off 8pm BST."

The former Denmark striker, who played in England for Newcastle, led Malmö to back-to-back Swedish titles before leaving last December. Tomasson takes over from Tony Mowbray, who departed last month after an eighth-placed Championship finish. Tomasson has been coaching since his retirement as a player in 2011 and had spells in charge of Excelsior and Roda JC in the Netherlands before working as an assistant with Vitesse Arnhem and Denmark. The 45-year-old, who also played for Feyenoord, Milan and Villarreal among other clubs, described Blackburn as having “a lot of tradition and also great ambition”. Blackburn were Premier League champions in 1995 but have not been in the top division since 2012. “We have a young team here, and also a great academy, and the owners have a clear vision, which is to develop players and become a sustainable Premier League club over time, so I’m really happy to be involved in this exciting new chapter,” Tomasson said. He led Malmö to the 2021-22 Champions League group stage by winning four qualifying ties. The team were twice beaten by Chelsea and finished bottom of a group that also included Juventus and Zenit St Petersburg. Blackburn’s director of football, Gregg Broughton, referenced the “aggressive, offensive style” used by Tomasson at Malmö and the CEO, Steve Waggott, said: “His work around developing players, along with demanding a culture of giving everything to the club, is exactly what we need.”"

This land is her land. It lives deep in her childhood of long summerhouse holidays, the beach nearby, surrounded by daisies, cornflowers, poppies and pine trees. We are lucky in London to live close to Hampstead Heath, more like countryside than a city park (though less so in lockdown). There were picnics after primary school. Later, flying kites with the kids – perhaps more my thing than theirs. Always long walks. This we still do. The roof terrace was more mine at first. Climbers, annuals, often in primary colours, reds and blues. Then came the allotment. The girls would visit with Henri, picking beans and peas and flowers. The roof terrace morphed, became more architectural. Better plants and pots. Henri fending off my over-enthusiasm. Then she found the summerhouse, a Nordic beach hut with her childhood friends close by. Crucially, not too far from her mother. Northern woodland with a sea soundtrack. Almost no intervention here, though we plant bulbs at the edges, and an occasional birch or beech. There are perfect hepatica and primrose, cowslips and snowdrops in abundance, shy violets snuggled like sleepy mice in shelter. Here, Henri shrugs off the UK and the city. She lightly wears her Danish identity. She mows the grass, trims the edges. I sometimes try to take away her secateurs. We live outside. We eat to the sound of the sea. We wander around in wonder. We often go down to the beach for the sunset. Sometimes with a summer beer, occasionally a winter whisky. I have slowly learned a lesson here. I don’t always need to shape a garden, an inside or outside space. It is even better to let land reshape you. Happy birthday, Henri. Tusind tak.

There are bonfires on the beaches and in many people’s gardens. Fireworks. The works. The Scandi sun is now rising before 4.30am and setting nudging 10pm. More than 17 hours of sunlight, clouds willing. Farmers here are in their fields much of that time. Making hay for fodder, tending barley, wheat and livestock. Verges are encouraged to flower. A percentage of farmland has by law to be left wild. Hundreds of buttercups compete with thousands of daisies. Poppies are in abundance. Wild blue-eyed chicory colours the roadside. Roads closest to the sea are often reserved for cyclists and walkers. There is a comforting constant soundtrack of cuckoo and skylark. It is not all idyllic, of course. Jylland farmers near us like to spray their fields with pig slurry, which can be challenging. Wild works here. Purple vetches grow in profusion on the plot, like miniature sweet peas and are beloved by every type of bee. We have apple trees, espalier pears. There will be blackcurrants for jamming, if Henri’s brother can get to them before the birds. The redcurrants we leave for them. The only other things we grow for flavour are the woodier herbs and abundant chives. There are, of course, occasional sown nasturtium, though they don’t always thrive in our dry and sandy soil. In the past year we have been here more often than before so I have added a wild meadow mix There are leggy lilac hedges first planted here more than 60 years ago. Many of our neighbours have replaced theirs with laurel and other evergreens. Keen to keep ours, I cut some close early last summer. They’ve filled out, flowered and grown another four or five feet.

For the second time in two matches they’ve had more than 20 attempts on goal and lost. Belgium, for their part, become the first team in this tournament, to come from behind and win. I’ll leave you with Nick Ames’s report from Copenhagen. Thanks for joining and goodnight. Group B: It’s all over in Copenhagen, where Belgium have come from behind to win by the odd goal of three and book their passage to the last 16. The second half introduction of Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Axel Witsel made all the difference to Belgium, but Denmark can take heart both from an excellent first half performance and the fact they went down swinging haymakers. Metaphorical haymakers, to be clear. 90+5 min: Kasper Schmeichel goes up for a corner and Belgium almost score int his vacant goal after Lukaku heads the inswinger away. He gets away with it. One last counter-attack for Denmark, but they can’t get near the Belgium goal. 90+3 min: Courtois dawdles over a goal kick, prompting somebody in the stand behind thge goal to throw a cup of what one hopes is officially Uefa-approved beverage in his general direction. It lands on the pitch behind him. 90+2 min: Cornelius gets goal side of Denayer but falls over before he can make contact with a bouncing ball on the edge of the six-yard box. 90+1 min: Into the first of five mooted minutes of added time we go. Can Denmark rescue a point one suspects not even Belgium fans would begrudge them? 89 min: Now it’s Belgium who are hanging on, as Denmark lay siege to their goal. They’re sending cross after cross into the penalty area, the substitutes Cornelius and Olsen both wreaking something resembling havoc. 87 min: Oof! Martin Braithwaite hits the intersection of crossbar and upright with a header after getting the jump on his man to connect with an Olsen cross from the right. 86 min: Now Maehle curls a cross towards the same area. Vertonghen heads clear. 86 min: Braithwaite curls a cross to the far post, where Thibaut Courtois plucks it from the sky. 85 min: Denmark substitution: Jannik Vestergaard off, Andreas Olsen on. 84 min: Cornelius squares the ball across the face of goal but Martin Braithwaite is unable to poke it goalwards. 82 min: Thorgan Hazard goes down suffering from cramp and gets no sympathy from the crowd, who boo him, or the referee, who orders him to the touchline if he wants to receive treatment. 82 min: Mathias Jensen is booked for a late challenge on Tielemans. 80 min: Courtois carries on while Belgium pass the ball around amongst themselves. They are unrecognisable from the rabble who traipsed off at half-time. It’s no great surprise, considering the identity of their second half substitutes. 78 min: There’s a break in play as Thibaut Courtois receives treatment for a knock to his left knee. 76 min: Alderweireld sticks out a leg and blocks a Braithwaite shot from the edge of the Belgian penalty area. Moments previously, the sides had exchanged shots, Denmark’s coming from Cornelius and Belgikum’s from De Bruyne after good work from Lukaku. 75 min: Denmark double-substitution: Andreas Cornelius and Mathias Jensen on for Mikkel Damsgaard and Thomas Delaney. 72 min: Kevin De Bruyne fired low past Kasper Schmeichel from the edge of the Denamrk penalty, finishing a move in which played Eden Hazard, Axel Witsel and Romelu Lukaku all played their part. The ball was pinged hither and yon at mesmerising speed and a minimum of touches on the fringe of the Denmark penalty area before De Bruyne found hilmself in space and leathered it into the bottom left-hand corner. Belgium go in front. And it’s another one from the PlayStation. 69 min: Delaney tries to play Maehle in behind with a wonderful through ball, but Denayer does well to intercepot. He undoes his good work by giving the ball away to Damsgaard, who throws himself to the ground in the Belgium penalty area. Yellow card. 68 min: Kevin De Bruyne tries to play Lukaku in behind after receiving a wonderful pass from Eden Hazard. Simon Kjaer makes a crucial interception. 66 min: Having looked likely winners for so long in this game, Denmark now look in trouble and struggling to hang on for a draw. They were never going to be able to maintain their energy levels of the first half. 65 min: Belgium corner. Kevin De Bruyne’s delivery flashes across the face of goal but nobody in a white shirt can get a touch on it. Simon Kjaer heads the ball clear. 62 min: Danish double-substitution: Jens Stryger Larsen and Christian Noergaard on for Daniel Wass and Yussuf Poulsen. 60 min: Belgium double-substitution: Axel Witsel and Eden Hazard on for Dendoncker and Carrasco. This is Witsel’s first proper game since January, when he suffered a bad achilles injury. 59 min: Daniel Wass is booked for a late challenge on Thomas Meunier. 56 min: Thorgan Hazard slots home from six yards out to finish a wonderful move by Belgian. Romelu Lukaku finally got in behind the Danish defence and pulled the ball inside to Kevin De Bruyne from the right side of the penalty area. With three players converging on him in the Danish penalty area, he ignored two opportunities to shoot, waiting instead to thread the ball across the face of the six-yard box, where an incoming Thorgan Hazard had the relatively straightforward task of poking home from six yards. That is a wonderful equaliser! “It’s a PlayStation goal,” says Ally McCoist on co-comms for ITV. He’s not wrong. 54 min: Simon Kjaer leaps to cut out an attempted Tielemans dink in behind with his head. 52 min: Lukaku receives the ball in acres of space wide on the right. He tries to cut inside and run towards the penalty area, but Vestergaard comes out to put a stop to his gallop and thump the ball into the stands. In doing so, the Danish defender earns himself a huge roar of approval from the stands. 50 min: Damsgaard draws a foul from Tielemans and wins a free-kick for Denmark just outside the Belgium penalty area, a few yards left of centre. He takes charge of the set piece but fires the ball straight into the defensive wall. 49 min: Tielemans stands the ball up for Thomas Meunier in the Denmark penalty area, but he makes a complete pig’s ear of his attempt at a header. He makes contact with the ball after mistiming his jump but doesn’t steer the ball anywhere near the Danish goal. 48 min: Thomas Delaney runs into space outside the Belgium penalty area and shoots from distance on the instruction of 25,000 fans in the stands. Wide. 47 min: Hoejbjerg lumps the ball long through the centre from just inside his own half but it sails straight through to Thibaut Courtois. 46 min: Belgium kick off, with Dries Mertens paying the price for his ineffectual first half performance. He’s replaced by Kevin De Bruyne, who makes his first appearance since suffering facial fractures in the Champions League final. Interestingly, he’s not wearing a mask. On ITV: Graeme Souness has said “Jan Vertonghen looks like he’s towing a carvan, he’s not up to the speed of this game.” It’s worth pointing out (a) Vertonghen came into this game carrying an ankle injury and (b) Belgium have Dedryck Boyata and Thomas Vermaelen on the bench, neither of whom are particularly speedy. If Denmark win: All four teams in this group will be on three points going into the final round of matches. Peep! Denmark lead by the only goal of the game, having gone ahead through Yussuf Poulsen inside two minutes after a quite blistering start that completely overwhelmed their opponents. They are well worth their lead against a Belgium side that already look bereft of ideas and have been peculiarly lethargic. I will be astonished if Roberto Martinez doesn’t make changes at half-time. There’s no shortage of quality on his bench, that’s for sure. 45 min: For Denmark, Maehle pulls the ball back to Hojbjerg on the edge of the Belgium penalty area. He loses it and Belgium break upfield only to lose the ball when they are smarmed by retreating Danish defenders. 44 min: From the free-kick, Yannick Carrasco tries to pick out Romelu Lukaku at the far post but his delivery is diabolically bad. Wide. 43 min: Romelu Lukaku runs at the Denmark penalty area but has the ball nicked off his toe by Simon Kjaer. Moments later, Lukaku wins a free-kick off the Danish captain, almost in line with the right side of the Denmark penalty area. 41 min: With half-time approaching, Denmark remain in the lead but may be annoyed that they have not converted more of their chances. They absolutely blitzed Belgium in the opening minutes and while Roberto Martinez’s side have worked their way back into the game, they have yet to create a chance of note. Denmark, by contrast, have had eight shots on goal, three of them on target. 39 min: Mertens and Meunier combine down the right for Belgium but their move comes to naught when Jannik Vestergaard gets involved and hoofs the ball clear. 37 min: Thomas Delaney lofts a high cross from the right towards Poulsen on the far side of the Belgium penalty area. With his back to goal, he controls it beautifully, taking it down with a wonderful fiorst touch. Dendoncker is right up his jacksy and doesn’t allow him to turn and get a shot off. 35 min: Now it’s Alderweireld’s turn to get caught on his heels and he loses the ball to Damsgaard. The man given the unenviable task of filling Eriksen’s size nines cuts inside and curls a low shot narrowly wide of the far upright. 34 min: Vertonghen gets caught napping on the ball by Vass about 10 yards outside his own penalty area. The Danish midfielder tries to pick out Poulsen with a pass, but overhits it. 31 min: Belgium win a corner. Carrasco plays it short to Thorgan Hazard, who passes it backwards to Tielemans. After a little more fannying and faff, they win themselves another corner. This one is sent straight into the penalty area, where Schmeichel gets a glove to the ball. 29 min: Another free-kick for Belgium out by the left touchline, this time for a foul committed by Dries Mertens. Once again, Daniel Wass’s delivery lets him down. He sends the ball far too close to Courtois, who gathers comfortably. 28 min: Leander Dendoncker concedes a free-kick wide on the left. Daniel Wass curls the ball into the Belgium penalty area but fails to clear the first man. 26 min: Denmark get the ball forward again with Braithwaite and Damsgaard combining well. Braithwaite picks out Daniel Wass, who unleashes a shot from the edge of the penalty area. The ball sails high and wide of Belgium’s goal. 25 min: Belgium are finally playing at the same speed as Denmark but are having no luck in getting the ball anywhere near Romelu Lukaku, who seems isolated up front. 22 min: Belgium get forward but a Thomas Meunier cross from the right flies straight into the arms of Kasper Schmeichel. Romelu Lukaku hasn’t had a meaningful touch of the ball yet. He may not have had a touch at all. 20 min: Almost three minutes pass without Denmark threatening to increase their lead. Belgium will be happy with that, no doubt. They are, remember, the No1 ranked team in the world according to Fifa. 17 min: Jason Denayer sticks his head in to prevent Braithwaite steering a header goalwards at the near post. Moments previously, Vertonghen and he had been caught out by a through ball down the inside right, which led to another Poulsen cross from the right. Courtois collected that one. 14 min: Vertonghen looks way off the pace here and is beaten for speed as Denmark get another cross in from the right. There’s nobody on hand to connect. 13 min: With Jan Vertonghen stranded in no-man’s land, Belgium’s Thomas Meunier gets back to prevent Denmark striker Mikkel Damsgaard poking home a Poulsen cross from the right. 12 min: Play having resumed, Belgium try to get a foothold in this game. They were absolutely blitzed in the opening six minutes but finally string a few passes together. 10 min: Play halts as all present in the ground, including the players and match officials, applaud Christian Eriksen, who can probably hear them from his hospital bed less than 400 meteres away. 9 min: Going back to the goal, which seems a long time ago. Denayer gave the ball away with a loose pass out of defence straight to Hoijbjerg. Denayer compounded his error by getting sucked into space outside the penalty area, leaving a clear path for the Spurs midifleder to find Poulsen on the edge of the area. He made no mistaske, shooting low and hard beyond the reach of Courtois into the bottom left-hand corner. 5 min: The Danish onslaught continues as Daniel Wass gets on the end of a cross from the left but steers a weak header into the arms of Courtois. Belgium plan to put the ball out of play so everybody in the ground can pay tribute to Eriksen on the 10-minute market. They must be wishing he wore No6 or No7, just so they can get a moment of respite a little earlier. 3 min: Belgium are all over the shop and almost go two gone as Joakim Maehle wriggles his way through the their penalty area, shoots and brings a smart save out of Thibaut Courtois, who can only parry the ball clear. Denmark lead! A mistake from Jason Denayer results in Yussef Poulsen picking up a pass on the edge of the penalty area and shooting low into the far corner. 1 min: Belgium’s Thorgan Hazard goes to ground wide on the right after finding himself on the receiving end of a “getting to know you” tackle from Daniel Wass. 1 min: Denmark get the ball rolling, their players wearing red shirts, shorts and socks. Their Belgian counterparts wear white shirts, shorts and socks. Not long now: As a giant “Eriksen No10” shirt is unfurled on the pitch, the players of both teams prepare to march out. Jan Vertonghen leads the Belgian side, while Simon Kjaer wears the armband for Denmark. Good luck to all of them on what must be a weird day. It’s time for the anthems and kick off is less than five minutes away. This just in: Never mind the near death experiences or concussions, Uefa have moved quickly to stamp out the growing menace of players ... moving drinks bottles out of shot at press conferences. Following Portugal skipper Cristiano Ronaldo’s decision to move a bottle of Coca-Cola out of the picture and replace it with water (a move subsequently aped by Italy’s Manuel Locatelli) and French midfielder Paul Pogba’s removal of a bottle of Heineken, Uefa have warned participating federations of their responsibilites to sponsors. “Uefa has reminded participating teams that partnerships are integral to the delivery of the tournament and to ensuring the development of football across Europe, including for youth and women,” they said. “We are never fining players directly from the Uefa side, we will do this always through the participating national association and then they could look if they will go further to the player, but we are not going directly for the moment to the player,” said tournament director Martin Kallen. Those teams: Roberto Martinez makes two changesd to his Belgium teamn. Thomas Meunier comes in for the injured Timothy Castagne, while Jason Denayer replaces Dedrick Boyata in defence. Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand also makes two changes and looks to be switching to three at the back for this game. With Christian Eriksen absent, Yannik Vestergaard comes into defence while Mikkel Damsgaard comes into the forward line for Jonas Wind. Group C: Andriy Shevchenko’s Ukraine have prevailed over North Macedonia in a lively game featuring three goals, two saved penalties and a soupcon of VAR in Bucharest, leaving Goran Pandev and chums reliant on Austria doing them a favour against the Netherlands tonight if they are to avoid going out in the group stages. Denmark: Schmeichel; Christensen, Kjaer, Vestergaard, Maehle; Wass, Hoejbjerg, Delaney; Poulsen, Damsgaard, Braithwaite. Belgium: Courtois; Alderweireld, Denayer, Vertonghen; Meunier, Dendoncker, Tielemans, Hazard; Mertens, Lukaku, Carrasco. A tribute: Both sets of players will halt play in the 10th minute of today’s game in order to take a moment so everyone in the stadium can send good vibes in the direction of Christian Eriksen. Ten, of course, being the Danish midfielder’s shirt number. Today’s match officials Referee: Bjorn Kuipers (Netherlands) Referee’s assistants: Sander van Roekel and Erwin Zeinstra (Netherlands) Fourth Official: Andreas Ekburg (Sweden) Video Assistant Referee: Pol van Boekel (Netherlands) Early team news It should go without saying that Denmark will be without Christian Eriksen. Kasper Hjulmand has an otherwise physically fit squad to choose from, but was planning to speak to the rest of his players individually in a bid to evaluate their state of mind following the traumatic events they watched unfold before making his selection for tonight. For Belgium, Axel Witsel (achilles) and Kevin De Bruyne (facial fractures) are reported to have recovered from the injuries that kept them out of Belgium’s tournament build-up and the opening game in Moscow and both could make their first appearances in the competition this evening. Jan Vertonghen is also reported to be fit but this match despite injuring his ankle against Russia. Timothy Castagne’s Euro 2020 campiagn is over after he suffered facial injuries in a collision with Daler Kuzyaev in Belgium’s opening win. Following the distressing events of Saturday night, when Christian Eriksen suffered cardiac arrest and was resuscitated on the pitch, the players of Denmark have had a few days to come to terms with what happened to their teammate, Having been left with little or no option to play on against Finland in a match they lost, they have had a chance to regroup, gather their thoughts and now must go again. Due in no small part to the heroic efforts of the medical staff who saved his life, Eriksen is currently recuperating in a hospital that’s just a Gareth Bale penalty kick away from the Parken Stadium and reports suggest he will be tuning in as his Denmark team-mates once again enjoy home advantage. We wish him all the very best in his recovery. The players of Belgium, by contrast, have been clocking up the mileage. Since Saturday, they have travelled home from St Petersburg following their win over Russia, before travelling to Copenhagen for tonight’s game. A draw should see them through to the last 16. Kick-off at the Parken Stadium is at 5pm (BST) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."
article70,‘Ridiculous’: Peter Schmeichel criticises Uefa over restarting Denmark game,2021-06-13 13:42:11,"['Christian Eriksen', 'Uefa', 'Denmark', 'Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Football politics', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Finland']","Uefa has been criticised for limiting the choice to Denmark for restarting their game against Finland to Saturday night or noon on Sunday. The Euro 2020 game at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen was suspended after Christian Eriksen fell to the ground towards the end of the first half. The Internazionale midfielder was given treatment on the pitch before being transferred to the nearby Rigshospitalet. The Danish football association, the DBU, later tweeted that he was “awake”. At first it was thought the game had been postponed but it was announced after a discussion involving both sets of players that it would restart. Denmark’s squad had received a message from Eriksen and decided to play. Their coach, Kasper Hjulmand, said after the 1-0 defeat: “We knew we had two options. The players couldn’t imagine not being able to sleep tonight and then having to get on the bus and come in again tomorrow. Honestly, it was best to get it over with.” However, during a press conference on Sunday, having had time to reflect, he said: “No, we should not have played. We will try tomorrow to establish normality as much as possible. Players have different reactions to shocks and trauma but we will try to get back to normal as much as possible. “I get the feelings from the players that maybe the time is too short to try to play football again, but maybe we can use it as a force to get together and try to go out and do our best in the next match. We will see if we can get ourselves together and play for Christian.” The team doctor, Morten Boesen, who confirmed that Eriksen had suffered a cardiac arrest, echoed Hjulmand’s thoughts when he said: “I don’t think the right decision was to play the game. We have had help from a psychological point of view at the hotel last night. Everyone expressed their feelings and how they saw the situation, and everyone was pleased we talked it through.” The fact the players had the option only of playing on the night or early the following day has drawn widespread criticism in Denmark. The former international Michael Laudrup told TV3+: “You have to make a decision so soon after a big emotional event and that, I believe, is wrong. There they [Uefa] should just have said: ‘We won’t play more tonight, of course, and then we will look at what possibilities there are.’ “I respect the fact that our players took the decision together with the Finns but, when a thing like that happens, your emotions are in control of you and you don’t have the ability to look up and make an important decision. There has to be someone who says, ‘We stop here’, and then we have to have a look at it. And by ‘we’ I mean the organisation, Uefa. “To play at noon the following day didn’t make sense. Several of the players wouldn’t have slept and then you have to get up at 8am, drive to Parken for 10am and then play at noon.” Another former Denmark international, Peter Schmeichel, was also upset at the limited options. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “Something terrible happens and Uefa gives the players an option to go out and play the game, the last 55 minutes or whatever it was, or come back at 12 o’clock [the next day]. I mean what kind of option is that? “It was not an option, it was a ridiculous decision by Uefa and they should have tried to work out a different scenario and show a bit of compassion and they didn’t. I don’t know [about other solutions], but why 12 o’clock? Why take TV scheduling and all of that into consideration. Why 12 o’clock? “That was ridiculous and, to be fair, the result of the game is completely irrelevant and I have to be very honest … we obviously made a decision if the players come out and play they will only play if Christian is all right and by all right it means he is alive and speaking to the players; they knew he was OK.” Uefa has been asked to comment."
article71,Christian Eriksen sends greetings to Denmark teammates from hospital,2021-06-13 09:29:27,"['Christian Eriksen', 'Denmark', 'Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","The Danish football association, the DBU, has provided an update on Christian Eriksen’s condition, saying he is in a stable condition and will stay in hospital for further examinations. The midfielder collapsed on the pitch towards the end of the first half of Denmark’s opening Euro 2020 game against Finland. Eriksen was quickly attended to by medical staff and was given CPR while his teammates created a circular shield to prevent fans and TV cameras from looking in. Eriksen was taken to the nearby hospital Rigshospitalet and the Danish FA tweeted that he was awake at 6.30pm on Saturday. On Sunday morning it tweeted an update, which said: “This morning we have spoken to Christian Eriksen, who has sent his greetings to his teammates. His condition is stable, and he continues to be hospitalised for further examination. “The team and staff of the national team has received crisis assistance and will continue to be there for each other after yesterday’s incident.” Denmark, according to the manager, Kasper Hjulmand, were given two options by Uefa: to play the game on the night or the following day. After hearing from Eriksen the players decided to go out on to the pitch again. Finland won 1-0 but as Hjulmand said after: “This was not about football”. In its statement the Danish FA said: “We would like to thank everyone for the heartfelt messages to Christian from fans, players, the royal families from both Denmark and England, international associations, clubs etc. “We encourage everyone to send their greetings to the Danish FA, where we will make sure they are all passed on to Christian and his family.”"
article72,Matildas show glimpses of progress amid calamity in Denmark | Samantha Lewis,2021-06-10 23:52:35,"['Matildas', ""Women's football"", 'Football', 'Australia sport', 'Sport']","There is perhaps no clearer a measurement of the Matildas’ post-match mood than the press conferences of their captain, Sam Kerr. Following Australia’s 5-2 loss to Germany last month, Kerr was a tightly-packed tangle of frustration, having been kept largely silent while watching her team get picked apart. She answered questions in short, abrasive sentences, barely containing her fury. On Friday, though, despite another loss – this time to Denmark – Kerr cut a more relaxed figure; her sentences rolling, her voice warmer. She said all the things you say as a captain after a loss, of course – “we’ve got to be better”, “it’s disappointing”, “not good enough”. But she also cut through to the point of this series of friendlies as Australia prepare for the Tokyo Olympics in just over a month’s time. “This is part of a process for us; we’re building something here,” she said. “This is only our third game with Tony [Gustavsson]. This week has been really hard. It’s not just about this game. Obviously it’s disappointing, we want to win every game, but at the end of the day, it’s a process and we’re working towards something.” That “something” will not be visible in the three-minute highlight videos that flash across screens over the next 24 hours, but if you watch Australia’s opening 10 minutes against Denmark, you can see it start to take shape. The Matildas dominated the side ranked 16th in the world both on and off the ball. Their high, collective press was more energetic and choreographed; the return of starting full-backs Steph Catley and Ellie Carpenter allowed for overloads as well as balls into higher, wider channels; passes were more accurate and more deliberate; and a more experienced midfield helped pull Danish defenders out of shape to create space for Kerr to exploit in behind. Indeed, Kerr could have had two goals in two minutes were it not for an offside call that disallowed a tidy volley in the third minute, and the heroics of Denmark’s player of the match, goalkeeper Lene Christensen, who parried a Kerr strike before smothering the follow-up from Hayley Raso moments later. Australia had 70% of the territory as the game ticked into the 10th minute; pressing Denmark so effectively that they had barely ventured into their attacking half. It was, as Gustavsson said after the match, “very close to [a] perfect 10 minutes, except that we didn’t put away those chances.” But a game of football is 90 minutes long and, as the Matildas soon discovered, a lot can happen within them. While they dominated possession, territory, shots, passes and chances created, it was Denmark who opened the scoring and almost galloped away with the lead in their own 10-minute burst. On Denmark’s first set piece of the afternoon in the 14th minute, a poor defensive clearance from Tameka Yallop saw the ball spin into her own top corner, putting the Danes ahead without them having a single shot. Five minutes later, it was 2-0 after a chaotic corner saw the ball fall to full-back Rikke Sevecke who rifled home, even though replays showed an offside teammate in the build-up. By the end of their own period of domination, Denmark were three to the good – though, again, not through much of their own work after goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold misread the flight of a floated cross, palming it into her own net instead of making what appeared to be an easy catch. Deflated from the first own goal, Australia’s press naturally weakened; their attacking momentum and confidence blunted. Passes became a little less certain, final decisions a little less clear. By half-time, Denmark had scored more goals than they had taken shots – a statistic that encapsulated the game overall. However, as Kerr said, this game – as well as the one against Sweden next week – is part of a process. We saw another part of that process, too, in the substitutions Gustavsson made at half-time. Eighteen-year old striker Mary Fowler, who replaced the ineffective Caitlin Foord, scored her debut goal in the 86th minute while Emily Gielnik, who replaced Hayley Raso, delivered the corner headed home by Clare Polkinghorne in the 90th. “I can’t look away from the fact that we won the second-half 2-0,” Gustavsson said. “And if I count the caps of the players on the park [including those of debutants Kyra Cooney-Cross and Courtney Nevin], it’s interesting. “I know how this business works and it’s a lot of focus on starting XIs and such, but I know from experience that you need – especially in an Olympics – all the players. And therefore, if you might not start a game, it doesn’t mean you’re not important. You can be even more important finishing the game.” But it was Kerr, as always, who summarised it best. “Today, we didn’t really prepare for Denmark. We prepared for the Olympics.” The process thus continues."
article73,‘A fragment of eternity’: the mesmerising murmurations of Europe’s starlings,2022-06-04 20:00:09,"['Photography', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Birds', 'Wildlife', 'Animal behaviour', 'Animals', 'Science', 'Environment']","Søren Solkær was 10 when he witnessed his first starling murmuration, on the west coast of Denmark: more than 100,000 birds, making movies in the sky as they were being corralled by a falcon. It would be nearly 40 years before the photographer, best known for intimate, often playful portraits of artists and musicians, would revisit this scene of his youth, setting aside a week to capture the birds in motion. That was five years ago, and Solkær hasn’t stopped, making the murmurations the subject of an exhibition and book, Black Sun. “I’ve pretty much done it every winter ever since, and I don’t have any plans of stopping anytime soon,” he says. Before then, and despite his childhood awakening, Solkær had never turned his lens to birds. “I still don’t photograph individual birds, because I don’t find it visually interesting to just depict a bird, it doesn’t interest me artistically.” In fact, there are eight individual portraits of starlings in Black Sun. Solkær says that was to give colour and context to the bigger picture, “because they really look like small dots of ink in my big photographs. I wanted to show that they’re really beautiful, metallic birds.” Solkær became obsessed with the starlings – not just the shapes they made with their highly coordinated movements, but in their ecology, as he followed their migration across Europe, from Denmark to Rome to Catalonia. He began by the Unesco World Heritage-listed Wadden Sea, the largest unbroken system of intertidal mudflats in the world, which stretches along parts of the Danish, German and Dutch coasts. Here, every spring and autumn, the skies are darkened by murmurations, known locally as “sort sol” – or “black sun”, hence the book’s title. Why starlings murmurate is not fully understood. One theory is that massive numbers help the birds keep warm before going to roost; another is that it maximises each individual’s chance of survival when under assault by aerial predators. How the birds move together in such close proximity, as though one organism, is another mystery. One study found that each starling was responding instantly to the six or seven birds closest to it to maintain group cohesion. The time Solkær invested in the project paid off. “I think a lot of photography only gets interesting if you really go deep with it, and images start to appear that most people wouldn’t get because they don’t spend enough hours doing it.” When Solkær started the project, he says, he read poetry and studied paintings of the murmurations dating back to the 17th century, and was struck that the fascination people felt at the time mirrored his own. He says his photographs of the birds are an attempt to capture “a fragment of eternity”. He estimates that he’s been out on about 200 nights, and on each occasion the spectacle has been unique, never to be repeated. That, he says, makes the scene timeless, and at the same time keeps it fresh. “It’s such an ephemeral sensation. You know that it’s happening right now, in a second it’s gone and it will never come back, and I find that really fascinating. It’s one of the most exciting things I’ve ever tried. It can compete with seeing Arcade Fire or Amy Winehouse on a big stage at Glastonbury and being on stage with them – I think this is equally exciting.” • Black Sun is at the Nanda\Hobbs gallery in Sydney until 11 June."
article74,Tour de France 2022: stage-by-stage guide | William Fotheringham,2022-06-29 13:00:40,"['Tour de France', 'Cycling', 'Sport']","Stage 1, Friday 1 July: individual time trial, Copenhagen, 13.2km A tour of the Danish capital’s beauty spots – the Little Mermaid, the Kastellet fortress, the Tivoli Gardens – in a time trial opener that is long enough to create real time gaps between the main contenders, and has a wealth of corners to cause mayhem if it rains. The distance will suit Primoz Roglic but the big favourite will be a specialist such as Filippo Ganna (Ineos) or Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma). Stage 2, Saturday 2 July: Roskilde-Nyborg, 202.5km Much of this stage is barely above sea level with only a couple of tiny climbs but if the wind blows it could create significant time gaps, particularly in the final 18km over the dramatic – and completely exposed – Great Belt bridges. Jumbo-Visma and Ineos are masters at exploiting crosswinds, but the real experts are Quickstep-Alpha Vinyl; their sprinter Fabio Jakobsen is the favourite, along with fellow Dutchman Dylan Groenewegen. Stage 3: Sunday 3 July: Vejle-Sønderbørg, 182km The run south down the Jutland peninsula is on less exposed roads than the day before so, assuming the wind is favourable, it should produce the first “routine” sprinters’ stage of the race, with Jakobsen – who has ousted Mark Cavendish as Quickstep’s preferred Tour sprinter – taking on the likes of Caleb Ewan and Jasper Philipsen. The following day the caravan transfers south to France. Stage 4: Tuesday 5 July: Dunkirk-Calais, 171.5km Relatively short, and with a series of short, sharp climbs inland from the Channel coast, this stage will be “nervous”, as the riders put it, although the pattern should be familiar, with an early break of riders from the smaller teams looking to scoop up points on the five ascents. However, the final 25km along exposed roads around Cap Gris Nez could split the field if the wind blows from the north-west. Stage 5, Wednesday 6 July: Lille-Arenberg Porte du Hainault, 157km Assuming the Great Belt has been kind to the field, this is the first decisive day, with 11 stretches of treacherous cobbles in the final 80km. There will be a huge battle to be at the front for the first section at Villers-au-Tertre and that is bound to lead to crashes. In 2014, Vincenzo Nibali effectively won the Tour in a similar stage; this year, the big favourites will be Van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel. Stage 6, Thursday 7 July: Binche-Longwy, 220km The longest stage of the race has a twist in the tail: the Côte de Pulventeux comes 6km from the finish, and is 800m at 12%, so steep enough to split the field before the finish up the longer, draggier, Côte des Religieuses. It is a finish made for any of the overall contenders, but all eyes will be on Van der Poel with Julian Alaphilippe absent. Stage 7, Friday 8 July: Tomblaine-La Planche des Belles Filles, 176.5km The first mountain-top finish; the super-steep “Plank” is relatively short at 8km, and with no major climbs beforehand, time gaps at the top should be relatively tight. The early break should contest the stage win – if Thibaut Pinot has lost time early on this is an obvious target – but for the big names the equation is pretty simple: if Tadej Pogacar gains time, he’s set fair for a third win. If not, all bets are off. Stage 8, Saturday 9 July: Dôle-Lausanne, 186.5km The sprinters have every right to feel short-changed in this Tour; for example today, what could have been a routine flat finish in the home of the International Olympic Committee is spiced up with a demanding climb with pitches at 12%. So it’s another day for the “puncheurs” – Van Aert, Van der Poel, perhaps Tom Pidcock – and one where the overall contenders will need their wits about them to avoid losing time in the finale. Stage 9, Sunday 10 July: Aigle-Châtel, 193km Into the mountains with two first category climbs on this mainly Swiss stage. The main climb, Pas de Morgins, won’t be hard enough to separate the serious contenders for overall victory, and the stage win should go to a rider from the early break, where the riders will also have an eye on the mountains prize. A day for specialist stage hunters – the likes of the Frenchman Benoît Cosnefroy, or the Dutchman Bauke Mollema. Stage 10, Tuesday 12 July: Morzine-Megève, 148.5km After a second rest day, a stage in the Alps that skirts the biggest climbs; with much more to come, the favourites are likely to mark each other, with a big battle for the stage win from an early break. The 19km drag to the finish is where it will all happen; that will favour the likes of France’s Warren Barguil or Van der Poel. Stage 11, Wednesday 13 July: Albertville-Col du Granon, 152km A brutal day in the Alps, with two massive climbs in the final 80km. The lengthy Col du Galibier is the high point of the race, while the Granon is the highest stage finish since the Galibier in 2011. The length of the main climbs means the break is unlikely to succeed, so the overall favourites may well fight out the stage win: if a contender such as Pogacar or Jonas Vingegaard wins here, they will be in pole position for the final title. Stage 12, Thursday 14 July: Briançon-Alpe d’Huez, 165.5km Cruelly, the organisers make the riders go back up the Galibier the way they came over less than 24 hours earlier, before crossing the Croix de Fer to tackle l’Alpe d’Huez for the first time since 2018. That year’s winner, Geraint Thomas, looks to be back to his best form; today, the chances are the victor will come from an early break, and given it’s Bastille Day all France will be rooting for Pinot or Romain Bardet. Stage 13, Friday 15 July, Bourg d’Oisans-Saint Étienne, 193km The transitional road from the Alps to the Massif Central is well trodden, and this stage has enough climbing to make it hard to control the race; the early break is odds-on to succeed. The battle to get into the winning move will be intense, and the flat finish favours a specialist stage hunter with a sprint, such as Denmark’s Magnus Cort Nielsen or Van der Poel if he’s still in the race. Stage 14, Saturday 16 July: Saint Étienne-Mende, 192.5km Another day for the breakaway specialists, with a monstrously steep uphill finish on the airfield at Mende, where the Briton Steve Cummings won in 2015. The same large group of riders as the day before will try to make the winning move; the winner will be a strong climber such as Barguil or Adam Yates. Stage 15, Sunday 17 July: Rodez-Carcassonne, 202.5km On paper, today – finally – favours the sprint teams, but they will face a fierce battle to control things, with a lengthy third category climb 50km from the finish. The sprinters haven’t had a clear-cut sprint day since stage four, so won’t want to miss this one: let’s hope enough teammates have survived the Alps to keep it together. Stage 16, Tuesday 19 July: Carcassonne-Foix, 178.5km The first stage in the Pyrenees with two first category mountains; hard enough for the early break to target the stage, but not hard enough to induce the overall contenders to do more than keep a watching brief. With 27km downhill to the line, the finish is for a good climber who can descend well: perhaps Bardet, or the Dane Jakob Fuglsang, or that old lag Mollema. Stage 17, Wednesday 20 July: Saint Gaudens-Peyragudes, 130km Very short, with a saw-tooth profile over three first category climbs; the break won’t stay away today, but anyone targeting the mountains jersey will try to get in to a move that will at least survive until the final 20km. For the overall favourites, another day to keep things under control, while trying to glean a few seconds on the final ascent. The winner will come from the select group contesting the yellow jersey: why not Roglic? Stage 18, Thursday 21 July: Lourdes-Hautacam, 143.2km Another stage that is too short for a break to gain much time before the big names get moving. It’s a brutal course covering the legendary Col d’Aubisque and the unknown Col de Spandelles before the final haul to a bleak plateau. The winner will probably be in the top six overall, and he will be odds on to take the final victory. Think Pogacar, Roglic, Vingegaard or, from the left field, the Australian Ben O’Connor. Stage 19, Friday 22 July: Castelnau-Magnoac-Cahors, 188.5km A classic – and rare – “transition” stage designed to get the race towards the final time trial and Paris, and one surely with a sprinter’s name on it, depending on who has survived the Pyrenees with a few teammates around them. By now, however, it’s not just a matter of the fastest, but those who can get over the mountains with some reserves: think the Aussie Michael Matthews or the Dane Mads Pedersen. Stage 20, Saturday 23 July: Lacapelle Marival-Rocamadour individual time trial, 40.7km The longest solo time trial the Tour has seen since 2014 could go either way: the organisers’ dream is a cliffhanger with the overall outcome in the balance, while the usual reality is that the winner is already well clear and the contre la montre goes to a specialist. In the latter case, if Ganna has got through the mountains he will win, otherwise all eyes will be on Van Aert. Stage 21, Sunday 24 July: Paris La Défense-Champs Elysées, 116km Rumour has it the men’s Tour finish may – unprecedentedly – move away from Paris in 2024, and given that the formula now looks tired that would be no bad thing. Before the sprinters get to do their worst – Van Aert will be widely tipped to repeat his win of last year – the fans will see stage one of the relaunched Tour de France Femmes, which uses the legendary circuit to kick off a keenly anticipated week’s racing."
article75,"Denmark are not underdogs against England, says coach Kasper Hjulmand",2021-07-06 18:05:55,"['Euro 2020', 'Denmark', 'England', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","The Denmark coach, Kasper Hjulmand, has said he does not like the underdog tag his team have been given before the Euro 2020 semi-final against England at Wembley. The 49-year-old admitted that England have a very good team but he does not see his side as being underdogs or inferior in any way to their opponents. “We are in a phase now with the national team that we are moving away from being the underdog all the time,” he said. “We try to take the initiative regardless of who our opponents are. We try to be proactive and score goals. I don’t like the underdog mentality. Our mindset is not like an underdog. We are out to create chances and attack. We have the mentality that we can go out and beat whoever we are playing.” Denmark qualified from a group containing Belgium, Russia and Finland and have since beaten Wales and Czech Republic to reach the semi-final. They played their group games at home at Parken Stadium and Hjulmand knows the English players will benefit from the home support on Wednesday but he said it comes with extra pressure. “There is a lot of pressure on the English team compared to us. We can and will use this opportunity with everything we have got. They will be helped by the fans but there is also enormous pressure on them because everyone expects them to beat us.” He also challenged the Danish fans who will be at the stadium to be heard. “With thousands of Danish fans who live here [in the UK] I am sure we will hear them. We encourage them to be so loud as possible. We strongly believe that it will be difficult for England to beat us.” Hjulmand reported that the whole squad is available for selection for the game and thanked everyone back home who has supported them throughout the tournament. “We are happy that we are going out at Wembley to play a semi-final. It is like a dream coming true, for me and the players. This is why you start to play football. “We feel the support from back home. It is moving and it gives us strength so a big thank you to everyone at home. We are now playing England, they have a very good team and I have a a lot of respect for the English FA and what they have done over several years now. I have visited them several times [to see how they work]. “They have done a good job of developing players and have a good squad now with young players. They have won the Under-17 World Cup and the Under-20 World Cup recently. “It is a good team, but we are also a good team and we believe. We believe in ourselves and we are entering this game with enthusiasm. And one thing is clear, we will go on the pitch tomorrow and once again give everything we have got.” The Denmark goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, said he is not thinking about stopping football from coming home – asking whether “it has ever been home” before adding: “I haven’t been thinking about what it means to stop England. I have been focusing about what it will mean for Denmark if we win.”"
article76,Denmark could face legal action over attempts to return Syrian refugees,2021-07-29 05:30:22,"['Denmark', 'Refugees', 'Syria', 'European court of human rights', 'World news', 'Migration', 'Europe', 'Human rights', 'Middle East and north Africa']","Denmark’s attempt to return hundreds of Syrians to Damascus after deeming the city safe will “set a dangerous precedent” for other countries to do the same, say lawyers who are preparing to take the Danish government to the European court of human rights (ECHR) over the issue. Authorities in Denmark began rejecting Syrian refugees’ applications for renewal of temporary residency status last summer, and justified the move because a report had found the security situation in some parts of the country had “improved significantly”. About 1,200 people from Damascus currently living in Denmark are believed to be affected by the policy. Guernica 37, a London-based chambers which provides pro-bono and affordable assistance in transnational justice and human rights cases, is working with asylum lawyers and affected families in Denmark to mount a challenge to the government policy under the Geneva convention principle of “non-refoulement”. Neither the UN nor other countries deem Damascus as safe. “The situation in Denmark is deeply concerning. While the risk of direct conflict-related violence may have diminished in some parts of Syria, the risk of political violence remains as great as ever, and refugees returning from Europe are being targeted by regime security forces,” Guernica 37’s strategy note reads. “If the Danish government’s efforts to forcibly return refugees to Syria is successful, it will set a dangerous precedent, which several other European states are likely to follow.” Denmark is home to 5.8 million people, about 500,000 of whom are born abroad and 35,000 are Syrian. In recent years, however, the Scandinavian country’s reputation for tolerance and openness has been affected by the rise of the far-right Danish People’s party. Observers say the new stance on Syrian refugees – which also applies to refugees from other countries, although their numbers are smaller – is an attempt by the centre-left coalition in government to win back votes. Since Denmark does not have diplomatic relations with Bashar al-Assad’s regime, Syrian refugees whose residency renewals are denied face the prospect of being held indefinitely in detention centres. And in a cruel quirk, because the Danish authorities recognise that Syrian men are at risk of being drafted into the military or punished for evading conscription, most of those affected appear to be women and older people, many of whom face being separated from their families. Ghalia, a 27-year-old who was reunited with her parents and brothers when she arrived in Denmark in 2015, had her residency permit revoked in March. She is the only member of her family to be affected. While Ghalia is appealing against the decision, the uncertainty and worry of being separated again have left her unable to sleep, she said. “I feel nothing but fear about going into the immigration centre by myself, but I can’t return to Syria … it is like they believe we have a choice but if I go back, I will be arrested. You can’t do anything in the immigration centres, you can’t work, you can’t study. It’s like a prison. I’ll just waste my life away in there.” Carl Buckley, the barrister leading Guernica 37’s efforts, said taking a case to the ECHR in Strasbourg is one of several potential avenues affected Syrians could turn to if they exhaust the appeals procedure in Denmark. He said: “The ECHR is a slow-moving system, but we would make an application asking the court to consider interim measures, which would involve ordering Denmark to stop revoking residencies until a substantive complaint has been considered and ruled upon. “In theory that could happen pretty quickly. And while it would only apply to one individual’s case, we would hope that Denmark would consider it carefully or they will end up with thousands of similar applications.” Guernica 37 and a consortium of 150 Danish law firms working on asylum cases are hopeful it will not be necessary to take the Danish government to the courts. Faeza, 25, a nurse working in the northern town of Hillerrød, was treating Covid patients when Denmark’s immigration services invited her for an interview in August last year. “I was interviewed for eight hours. I was asked over and over, why hadn’t I returned to Syria? I said because it wasn’t safe.” Her permit was revoked in January of this year and she spent many stressful months appealing against the decision: like Ghalia, Faeza was the only person in her family who’d had their permit revoked. While the ruling was overturned in July, she remains terrified of being questioned again and the prospect of returning to Syria alone. “I am happy at the decision,” she said, “but I am now worried [in case it happens again]. As Syrian refugees, we are subject to unjust decisions.” Jens Rye-Andersen, an Aalborg-based immigration lawyer, said that he believes the rate at which residency permits are being revoked has slowed as a result of widespread criticism from the UN, human rights groups and the Danish public. “I think the government is listening to us, and I hope that they will drop the plans for the time being,” he said. “There have been a lot of changes in the asylum system in the last two years and clearly it’s not working very well. Experts who compiled the initial report the government used to show the security situation in Syria has improved are saying that their work has been misquoted. So I think the government doesn’t have a choice except to reconsider.” In 2018, hundreds of Somalis in Denmark had their permits revoked under a similar scheme. Some won their appeal to stay but, according to the Danish Refugee Council, many left Denmark and have disappeared, possibly to live without status in another country. For Ghalia, whose appeal court appointment has been delayed because her lawyer was sick, the waiting is agony. “I’m right back to that point when I first arrived in Denmark and feel helpless all the time,” she said. “I have no control over my life and I feel like I haven’t done anything to deserve this.”"
article77,Euro 2020: Maguire praises Southgate and Denmark – as it happened,2021-07-05 15:52:24,"['Euro 2020', 'Sport', 'Football', 'European Championship', 'England', 'Denmark', 'Italy', 'Spain']","In other non-Euro international news, Manchester City’s Ferran Torres and Rodri will not turn out for Spain at the Tokyo Olympics after their manager, Pep Guardiola, put his foot down. “Ferran Torres and Rodri [are] not going because they went to the Euros. It’s too much,. One tournament in a summer is enough. The clubs are the ones who pay the players and they need to protect their assets.” “The current match calendar is brutal and yet new competitions and tournaments keep being created,” Guardiola added in a broadside at this new-fangled ‘Olympics’ nonsense. Pep also backed Luis Enrique in trademark style: “You can’t know how happy I am for Luis Enrique. He deserves all this and more.” Nations League finals, eh? Yeah, I had forgotten about them too. The four-team knockout will be played in Italy this October. It will feature one Euro 2020 finalist, as Italy and Spain are there, meeting in the first semi-final at San Siro. Belgium will play France in Turin before the winners meet in the final on 10 October. Something to look forward to during the long, dull domestic break. Martínez likely to stay on with Belgium Speculation had been rife that Roberto Martínez might call time on his tenure as Belgium manager after their Euro 2020 exit. But the latest reports suggest the Spaniard will stay on for the 2022 World Cup cycle and Nations League finals. “Tomorrow we are already starting preparations for the [next] matches,” chief executive Peter Bossaert told Belgian radio. “Roberto Martínez will be there. No official communication will follow, but there is no reason to change the staff.” Harry Maguire on Denmark: “It’s been really inspiring their journey,” he said of Wednesday’s opponents. “First and foremost our thoughts have always been with Christian [Eriksen] and his recovery and we’re all right behind that. They’re a good team. They’ve proved that for years, they’re a top team, the highest-ranked team we will have played in this competition. They’re a strong team with great leaders in their team, great experience. We know it will be a tough game, but we’re really focused on ourselves.” Griezmann and Dembele issue ‘apologies’ after race row Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele have both released statements apologising after a video of the pair appearing to mock Asian hotel staff in Japan was circulated on social media over the weekend. Purported to have been recorded by Dembele in 2019, the video shows the France and Barcelona teammates laughing at staff attempting to fix a television in their hotel room. In it, Dembele is heard referring to “ugly faces” and “backward language” while Griezmann can be heard laughing. “Hello all, during these last few days, a private video dating back to 2019 has been circulating on social media,” Dembele wrote in an Instagram post. “It all took place in Japan. It could’ve taken place anywhere on the planet and I would’ve used the same expression. “I was therefore not targetting any community. I just happened to use this type of expression with my friends regardless of their origins. This video has since been made public. I appreciate therefore that it could’ve hurt the people present in these images. Because of this, I would like to sincerely apologise to them.” Following criticism on social media, Griezmann issued a statement of his own. “I have always been completely against all forms of discrimination,” he said. “For the past few days, certain people have wanted to paint me as someone that I am not. I firmly refute the accusations made against me and I’m sorry if I have offended any of my Japanese friends.” It is not the first time Griezmann has found himself in this kind of trouble. In 2017 the 30-year-old posted a photo of himself on social media dressed in “blackface” for a fancy-dress party. Harry Maguire on Gareth Southgate: “Well ever since I made my England debut I think Gareth has been brilliant for this team,” he said. “He sits here and gives us all the plaudits but we appreciate the job he’s doing and the way that he sets us up and his man-management skills. I can’t speak highly enough of Gareth and his coaching staff and the way that he’s gone about his business over the last four years. “He’s proved over the last four years that as an England manager it’s always hard to please everyone, especially the public, in terms of the way he sets up and selection. But we trust him. Whatever team he picks or whatever style of play he wants to go with, it’s the best one for the job.” More from Maguire: “The motivation is there,” he said, surprising nobody. “It’s the semi-final of the European Championship. Losing the semi-final at the World Cup hurt a lot. So we need to make sure when it comes on Wednesday night we get a positive feeling rather than the one we got against Croatia. “I think we’re in a lot better place than we were. The experience of that, we’ve learnt from it and also the experience of the games in between as well, for example the Nations League. We’ve had a lot of big games in that period to improve and a lot of time spent together on the training pitch, friendlies and qualifiers. Every game we play we feel we improve. “In this tournament, from the first game to the Ukraine game, there’s a lot of differences in the principles that we’re demanding from each other. Of course we’re in a better place now, but we’ve still got a long way to go.” Harry Maguire on Gareth Southgate: “I would be so happy for him if we went the distance,” he said. “Winning it was the aim before the tournament and it remains the aim now. I would be so happy for the whole county if we went on to win it. We are on the journey together and it is going well at the moment - I hope it carries on. I can’t speak highly enough of Gareth and what he has done for me and this team.” Harry Maguire speaks. Well, he’s about to. The England central defender, who has been so impressive since returning from his ankle injury, is due to address the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth Estate any minute now. England v Denmark: Danish midfielder Andreas Christensen has been chatting ahead of Wednesday’s semi-final and has said he fancies his side to give England a good game. “I feel like we have the qualities to play against everyone,” he said. “As a team, I would not say they are that much better,” he said. Read on ... Lundstram signs for Rangers. The Scottish champions have announced the signing of John Lundstram, whose contract with Sheffield United expired last week, on a three-year deal. The 27-year-old midfielder from Liverpudlian has made 62 Premier League appearances for the Blades across the past two seasons. “John is a player I have known for some time and knew he would enhance our squad,” said Rangers boss Steven Gerrard in a statement on the Rangers website. “Having played in the Premiership, he has the undoubted quality to enhance our midfield with his technical ability and physicality and I was impressed with his attitude and ambition when we spoke over recent weeks. John is a winner and knows what is required to succeed at a club of this stature. “He will add steel and presence to our midfield along with his quality which makes our squad much stronger, and to procure a player of John’s profile and experience is very pleasing. Myself and the staff are looking forward to working with John. We know he is also very excited to get started at Rangers.” Declan Rice: The England midfielder has been talking to the Official England podcast and has revealed that he has spent lots of his downtime while on Euro 2020 duty with England talking to celebrity West Ham fan ... James Corden. “He was with Mark Noble at the Germany game so I spoke to them after and they were buzzing,” said Rice. “There are people who don’t even like football or don’t sit down and watch it and now it is a ritual to lock in and watch the games in this tournament. “James Corden said to me, ‘Do you actually understand what you are doing?’ and I don’t really. It has not hit me yet and even when the tournament has finished it probably won’t hit me until my career finishes. “We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves but we know what is ahead of us and hopefully we can achieve a massive dream.” Speaking about England’s win over Ukraine, Rice felt England went about their job professionally at the Stadio Olimpico and said it was nice to play a game away from Wembley for the first time in the tournament. “It was an unbelievable night, the pressure was on us to go out and win because a lot of people expected us to beat Ukraine,” he said. “So we had to go out there and put a performance in and I think the early goal from H [Harry Kane] really settled us. “The game just really opened up and it was pretty much an easy night, one we could take control of and really control the game, pass the ball and there were loads of positives. “It was different but it was really nice to break it up and get away for a little bit. Obviously we have been in the UK for quite a while now so to get to Rome, lovely weather and an amazing stadium, to play there in a quarter-final is something ticked off.” James Corden, eh. Pre-season: While England’s players remain focussed on the Euros, plenty of their colleagues who play in the Premier League are back at their clubs to begin pre-season training today ahead of the big kick-off on the weekend commencing Friday 13 August, when Brentford will host Arsenal. England training: Bukayo Saka recovered from a knock and trained on Monday as England built up towards the Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark. Having topped Group D unbeaten, the Three Lions followed up a 2-0 win against Germany in the last 16 by beating Ukraine 4-0 in Rome at the weekend. Saka started against Germany last Tuesday but was not included in the squad for Saturday’s match at the Stadio Olimpico due to a slight knock. But the 19-year-old was back training with the rest of the 26-man squad on Monday as Gareth Southgate’s side stepped up their preparations for the Denmark semi-final. “He should be fine,” Southgate said on Sunday. “He did declare himself available for the game but we had not really had the chance to see him on the pitch and working at the level we felt would vindicate that decision. He will go back into full training with the group [on Monday] and he should be fine, yeah.” PA Sport. In Arsene we trust. Mr Wenger was a guest on beIN Sports on Saturday night and was complimentary about England’s performance. “It was the perfect night for English football,” he said. “The perfect night for the English team. They didn’t concede a goal, they secured an easy qualification and they could rest important players. “They scored three goals from crosses. Sometimes small things cause a big impact. Certainly the fact that Ukraine lost a centre back in the first half had an impact on the goals they conceded in the second half. They didn’t even jump for the crosses! They’re free headers. It’s not expected at that level “What was important for me tonight, for them, is that they didn’t concede a goal. As long as you don’t concede a goal the team focuses on defending well. That will be an important quality to go to the final and to win it”. Marcus Christenson’s Denmark scouting report A big noise on the Guardian football desk and a native of parts Scandinavian, Marcus is well placed to analyse the strengths, weaknesses, tactics and key men of Denmark ahead of their semi-final against England. Read on ... Leonardo Spinazolla: The unfortunate Italy full-back, one of the stars of Euro 2020, ruptured his achilles tendon during Italy’s quarter-final win over Belgium. With his team-mates currently en route from Florence to Luton Airport on a charter flight, the Roma man has travelled to Finland to undergo surgery on his injury. We wish him well. Italy’s footballers will be based in Harrow for the build-up to tomorrow night’s semi-final and will train at Barnet’s ground The Hive later this afternoon. Italy v Spain: Speaking ahead of tomorrow night’s semi-final, Spain’s Mikel Oyarzabal claimed his side are capable of beating Italy or anyone else on their day. “If we play as we know, we can beat anyone” he said. “We just have to trust our idea of football. “Italy have great players and it will be a very complicated game, they have shown their level and we know they are in a great moment. But the same goes for us.” The Real Sociedad forward claimed luck had nothing to do with their win over Switzerland in a penalty shoot-out, where he scored the decisive penalty. “We study goalkeepers and penalty shooters,” he said. “We have worked on penalties these days and surely the others will have done the same. It’s not a lottery, there’s a lot of work behind it.” Italy v Spain: Nicolo Barella spokeg to the press at his squad’s Coverciano training base yesterday. “The Spain side that won Euro 2012 had a collective and a midfield of great players, champions like Xavi and Iniesta inspired everyone, not just me, but I have different characteristics,” he said. “Today there is Busquets, who has been among the best in the world for many years.” From his own side, he singled Jorginho and Marco Verratti out for praise. “They are the two phenomenal players who direct the game for us,” he said. “I’m more focused on attacking. Jorginho rarely makes a mistake, he always chooses the right solution.” Danny Ings: Perhaps a little unlucky to have been left out of England’s squad for Euro 2020, Danny Ings has turned down the offer of a new four-year deal from Southampton. The 28-year-old has just begun the final year of his current deal and is rumoured to be the subject of interest from both Manchester City and Manchester United after scoring 14 goals for Saints last season. Kasper Hjulmand speaks ... Denmark have been in four major tournament semi-finals, most recently when they won the European Championship in 1992 when their players were summoned from assorted beaches around the world at short notice following the disqualification from the tournament of the former Yugoslavia, which had jusat broken up and was in the throes of civil war. Their current manager, Kasper Hjulmand has been talking ahead of Wednesday’s game. “Going into Wembley with 60,000 [England fans] is a motivation and of course the motivation for us is to silence this crowd,” he said. “We know it’s going to be difficult but the boys are ready. All of them play on a big stage on a daily basis.” Denmark’s Jannik Vestergaard also added his two cents. “England have a lot of famous players in the attacking part but they haven’t conceded yewt at this tournament so I think a lot of credit has to go to the defensive organisation in general,” said the Southampton defender. Two of the Guardian’s finest and funniest football writers will be getting their livestreamed chat on at 1pm (BST) on Friday ahead of Sunday’s Euro 2020 final. You are welcome to join them, free of charge, for what could be a preview of England’s most important football match since 1966 ... or a post mortem of where it all went horribly wrong for Gareth Southgate’s brave boys in the semi-final against Denmark. Whatever the subject of what promises to be an entertaining discussion, you can rest assured that there are far worse ways than passing an hour in the company of these excellent journalists. Click on this link to register for Friday’s event. Good morning everyone. It seems today is another day for England fans to bask in the glorious improbability of such an easy win in the knockout stages of a major tournament, before the nerves kick in ahead of Wednesday night’s semi-final against Denmark at some point tomorrow. Mason Mount and Declan Rice certainly didn’t look too stressed out as they relaxed in the pool at St George’s Park yesterday. It falls to me to pass over this blog into the warm hands of Barry Glendenning. There’s a Smiths lyric gag to be had here somewhere but I started something I couldn’t finish. And memories of that 2012 final abound. From Sid Lowe here in 2012, it was the moment that Spain team announced itself as the most dominant of all. They also met at Euro 2016, with Italy gaining revenge, and Giorgio Chiellini, ever present in tournaments since 2008, though it feels like 1978, getting one of the goals. The socials are in ahead of Tuesday’s rerun of the Euro 2012 final. Robert Kitson on how everything’s coming up England. And maybe Britain and Ireland too. Imagine, for comparison’s sake, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland coming together to compete as one in the European football championship. And, in some instances, being permitted only a few days’ preparation? How much chance of immediate success would they have? The only possible option is to do what the Lions have traditionally done: subvert their egos to the broader cause, hold tackle bags for others in the pouring rain if required and laugh along with mates who, days ago, were remote, unknown rivals. Sir Gareth spoke to HM Press Corps yesterday. It’s great to be coming back now. To go and have that different environment, preparation, focus was definitely helpful. But now to be coming back to Wembley is a great thing for us. It’s not for me to tell the fans how to be or what to be. Transfer news from Fabrizio Romano: from what I have seen of this player, he is seriously good. And therefore would probably be a total disaster. But he’s a huge talent. Camavinga, who has been selected for this month’s Olympics, last August became – at 17 years, nine months and 17 days – the youngest player called into a France senior squad since 1932. He came on against Croatia the following month, becoming their youngest debutant since 1914, according to Opta. Political balance corner, though only one of them gets the Three Lions lyrics right. The latest from the political/non-political Uefa algorithm that nobody understands. Uefa said in a statement on that occasion that it had no choice than to reject the action on the grounds that it “contravened its regulations as a political and neutral organisation”. It said due to the “political context” of the application, “a message aiming at a decision taken by the Hungarian national parliament”, Uefa had to decline the request. David Hytner on England’s “leadership group”. This is what the holy grail of tournament management looks like: players on the fringes making contributions, those off the pitch happy for them, fully supportive, prioritising the collective. If a team at these finals is only as strong as the attitude of its 26th squad member, England are in good shape for the semi-final against Denmark at Wembley on Wednesday. Sid Lowe spoke to César Azpilicueta. All the way back to my time with the Spanish categorías inferiores, we had the same DNA: control the play, combine, carry the weight of the game. Also, when I first started coming at 15, I did everything as I would in the senior squad, so that when the moment came you feel like you have lived this before, like you know what it’s like to be at a tournament. Every coach has their touch and Luis Enrique wants more intensity, we’re more aggressive. The intensity he likes has got us here. Barney Ronay on this England. At times it feels as though more creative energy has been poured into deconstructions of why England aren’t the very best, than into making sure they’re good enough. We were always nearly complete, always nearly so sweet. And nothing has ever been whiter than the Queen’s white gloves. Marcus has also submitted a scouting report on the Danes. Coach Hjulmand was originally supposed to take over from Hareide after Euro 2020 but because of the pandemic-enforced delay ended up coming in a year before the tournament. He has been a huge success. He shot to fame at Nordsjælland, winning the club’s first league title in 2012. A failed stint at Mainz, where he replaced Thomas Tuchel, did not dampen his enthusiasm. He returned to Nordsjælland before being approached to take over the national team. “He has been very important,” says Mæhle. “He is good at talking with the players and giving that freedom that many players need. He is a good coach and now a friend for us, too.” Marcus Christenson’s got the power, and ranks England as number one. England face Denmark at Wembley in the semi-finals on Wednesday believing they can go all the way. Gulp... The transfer window is open so there will plenty more where this came from when the Euros is done a week from now. “Keeping him is not just my goal, it’s our goal as a club,” Paratici, who joined Tottenham last month after leaving Juventus, told Sky in Italy. “I can’t wait to watch him play live. I’ve been really lucky in the past years because I’ve watched a lot of top players and strikers, like Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez, Álvaro Morata, Gonzalo Higuaín, and many more which now I forgot about.” Let’s start with a trip down Memory Lane from the ever excellent Nick Ames, who will be writing a similar piece on Denmark in 17 years... So the only target we had at Euro 2004 was to be competitive, represent the country with pride, and improve on that dreadful record in America. We had the inner belief that we could do that, but we didn’t really have the goal of qualifying from our group, it didn’t seem a realistic approach. We were just 100% determined to change the way we had approached that World Cup. Here we all are again, as the semi finals approach. The excitement is building across Italy, Spain, Denmark and dear old England as London takes on the role of host for the semis and final.

article78,Belgium’s attacking riches bail out creaking back line against Denmark | Jonathan Wilson,2021-06-17 19:57:05,"['Euro 2020', 'Denmark', 'Belgium', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","Perhaps this wasn’t the game for making proper judgments. Belgium were in the desperately awkward position of being the other team in the face of a great outpouring of Danish emotion, and for half the game they struggled in that role. But the introduction of Kevin De Bruyne, back after surgery on the facial injury he sustained in the Champions League final, changed everything. But beyond talk of the difficult emotion of the occasion or of De Bruyne’s brilliance, there are other issues for Belgium. Going forward after half-time, they looked like the side that had scored 40 goals in qualifying. Romelu Lukaku, the isolation of the first half ended, was exceptional. But that first half exposed major concerns about the defence: the foundations are creaking. This was, inevitably and quite rightly, about Christian Eriksen, about working through a lot of the anxieties of Saturday and about celebrating his survival. And, after that, about Denmark getting a win to put them in a position to reach the last 16. As they came on to the pitch Belgium had two functions. The first was to be respectful participants in the occasion – and their players will have been affected as well. Lukaku plays with Eriksen at Internazionale, and said: “Chris, stay strong, boy, I love you,” into a camera after scoring against Russia, while Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen were teammates of Eriksen’s for, respectively, five and six years at Tottenham. Then, from a football point of view, Belgium’s second task was to resist the inevitable adrenal Danish surge. But that resistance lasted only 99 seconds. The major doubt about Roberto Martínez’s side was always the ageing defence. Vertonghen is 34 and struggling with an ankle injury, while Alderweireld is 32. Between them in the back three, Jason Denayer, replacing Dedryck Boyata, is not Vincent Kompany. He does not offer anything like the same composure or authority, and he played a crucial role in Denmark’s opener. It wasn’t so much his weak pass out from the back that was to blame, although that was bad enough, as the way he compounded the problem by being sucked to the ball in trying to rectify the mistake, allowing Pierre‑Emile Højbjerg to lay in Yussuf Poulsen to score. The Danish surge, which could have brought two or three goals in the opening quarter, did eventually diminish, but Belgium’s defensive problems remained. Every time Mikkel Damsgaard and his delicate jinking feet got a run at him, Vertonghen looked uneasy. Eventually, it felt, Damsgaard was going to get clipped in the box or the ball was going to fall kindly for him to get a proper shot off. Belgium were fortunate it never quite did. Martínez has few defensive options: perhaps Boyata could come in, but he is not the most mobile. The only other centre‑back is the 35-year-old Thomas Vermaelen. With modern sports science age may just be a number, but some numbers are still bigger than others. Where there is De Bruyne, though, there is hope. As soon as he came on, it was a different game. Lukaku, isolated in the first half, had someone to link to midfield, and within 11 minutes the pair had combined to lay on the equaliser for Thorgan Hazard. The winner, a crisp finish from De Bruyne following a slick move initiated by Lukaku’s run down the right – an intoxicating combination of physical power and deft skill – arrived 16 minutes later. The arrival of Eden Hazard and Axel Witsel from the bench, both recovering from injuries, provided further impetus after the equaliser. Witsel’s presence at the back of the midfield had been particularly missed. And yet still there were Danish opportunities. For all that the momentum seemed to be with Belgium, this was not a composed end to the game from them. They did not simply see it out; they may not quite have been clinging on but it was never comfortable, they never seemed entirely in control. Thrilling as they were going forward, this was not at all convincing. In the first half that could perhaps be ascribed to circumstance, but not later on. The biggest problem is that this side, in a progressive 3-4-3, are designed to attack. Even if Witsel is fit enough to start from the knockouts onwards, even with Lukaku’s ability as the ultimate in de luxe target men, physical power matched with pace and tactical and technical ability, even with the class of De Bruyne and Eden Hazard, the back three cannot sit too deep. It has to link to the midfield. With three players in their mid-30s, plus Denayer and Boyata, the lack of pace at the back is a major issue. The clock has been ticking on this golden generation for a while; with 10 players aged 30 or more in the squad (and De Bruyne to turn 30 before the final) the alarm may soon be going off."
article79,The Fiver | Denmark’s dynamic charge and their stance on Qatar 2022,2021-10-12 15:43:40,"['Football', 'Sport']","GREAT DANES While whatabouting Newcastle fans who decorate their Social Media Disgrace Twitter avatars with photos of Mohammed bin Salman and the national flag of Saudi Arabia might not realise it, it is actually possible to get firmly behind your football team while feeling decidedly conflicted by the consequences of them doing well. On Tuesday night in Copenhagen, for example, Denmark fans will be cheering on their team as they seek to qualify for next year’s Human Rights World Cup, even though huge numbers of them feel their players should not play in any tournament hosted by Qatar. Of course, to even entertain the notion of boycotting the finals of a tournament, one first has to qualify for them and Denmark could do so later. Having won all seven of their qualifiers, scoring 26 goals and conceding none in the process, the Danes’ progress through Group F could scarcely have been more serene. A win over Austria will guarantee their passage to a tournament their players have repeatedly and openly criticised for some time. Back in March, before a game against Moldova, their players wore T-shirts bearing the slogan “football supports CHANGE” following reports that thousands of migrant workers have died in Qatar since it won the right to host the tournament. In the interests of pacifying the put-upon Fiver Lawyers, we should probably point out the the country’s government have repeatedly defended their working conditions. More recently, Denmark captain, Ballon d’Or nominee and living saint Simon Kjær stated that while he and his teammates were happy for the Danish FA (DBU) to deal with the “political struggles off the field”, he and his teammates remain emphatically against the HRWC finals being held in Qatar. “As captain, I must say that we players have not chosen the [Human Rights] World Cup 2022 to be played in Qatar and we are very critical of the conditions we see in the country,” he said. “Of course, we continue to fully and firmly support the DBU’s critical line towards Qatar. We players have several times publicly shown our position in relation to the [HRWC] in Qatar, but now we have to keep the focus on the game on the field.” Should Denmark win later, Kjær, his teammates and their fans are entitled to enjoy a party but don’t expect to see any of them dancing around the Parken Stadium wearing tea-towels on their head.

article80,England v Denmark Euro 2020 semi-final: Danish team scouting report | Marcus Christenson,2021-07-04 13:40:30,"['Euro 2020', 'Denmark', 'England', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","By beating the Czech Republic in Baku, Denmark have reached their fourth European Championship semi-final. They have won one, against the Netherlands in 1992, when they won the whole tournament, and lost two, in 1964 and 1984, when they fell to the Soviet Union and Spain respectively. This time they face England at Wembley on Wednesday. Kasper Hjulmand’s side has already been through an emotional rollercoaster this summer, from seeing their star player Christian Eriksen suffer a cardiac arrest in their opening game, which they lost 1-0 against Finland, to beating Russia 4-1 to go through to the knockout phase and the two subsequent wins against Wales and the Czech Republic. Here we look at how the team may approach the England game and what dangers await Gareth Southgate’s side, as well as clues of how to get the upper hand against them. Strengths They are, of course, driven by the togetherness borne from the horrible events of 12 June when Eriksen collapsed, but they were quite a formidable force even before that. Hjulmand has taken what Åge Hareide built from 2016 to 2020 but made them more expansive and attack-minded. The three-man defence with Simon Kjær, Andreas Christensen and Jannik Vestergaard has worked extremely well during this European Championship finals and up front there is unpredictability in the shape of Mikkel Damsgaard, Eriksen’s replacement in the starting XI, and Kasper Dolberg, who has three goals in the tournament including one against the Czechs. Weaknesses The Czechs showed in the quarter-final that it is possible to gain the upper hand in midfield by having an extra man in that area. Jaroslav Silhavy’s substitutions at half-time made an immediate impact and the Danes were under sustained pressure for 15 minutes until Hjulmand responded with his own double swap. But for that period of time the central midfielders Thomas Delaney and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg could not cope and after the changes Denmark were far less threatening going forward. The Czechs also showed that it is possible to get at the Danes in the air at set-pieces, although Tomas Soucek and Petr Sevcik did not manage to make the advantage count on this occasion. Tactics Hjulmand prefers a 3-4-3 formation although he is not afraid to change the system. The key to the success is the wing-backs, Joakim Mæhle and either Jens Stryger Larsen or Daniel Wass, who have to cover an extraordinary amount of ground – and have done that so far. The fact that Mæhle has done so well on the wrong side of the pitch – he plays on the right side for Atalanta but on the left for the national team – speaks volumes about his adaptability. The trio up front are also expected to track back and help the two central defenders. At one point during the game against the Czechs, around the half-hour, Dolberg, made a block just outside his own area. When the Czechs got the ball back and attempted another delivery, Damsgaard was there to prevent it reaching the danger area. Danger men Dolberg and Damsgaard are the creative sparks up front with the latter extremely good at finding pockets of space between the opponents’ defence and midfield. Damsgaard has been described as “the new Michael Laudrup” and seems to thrive at the biggest stage. He is only 21 years old. Barcelona’s Martin Braithwaite – formerly of Middlesbrough – is the third component in the Danish attack and is a hard worker but offers less of a goal threat. RB Leipzig’s Yussuf Poulsen has been coming off the bench in the past few games but has two goals in the tournament. Coach Hjulmand was originally supposed to take over from Hareide after Euro 2020 but because of the pandemic-enforced delay ended up coming in a year before the tournament. He has been a huge success. He shot to fame at Nordsjælland, winning the club’s first league title in 2012. A failed stint at Mainz, where he replaced Thomas Tuchel, did not dampen his enthusiasm. He returned to Nordsjælland before being approached to take over the national team. “He has been very important,” says Mæhle. “He is good at talking with the players and giving that freedom that many players need. He is a good coach and now a friend for us, too.” Momentum They can feel that the force is with them. They had incredible support at their first three home games at Parken and as the days have gone by the feeling that something special is in the making has only grown. For the Czech game they had T-shirts saying: “We are not going home, we are going on.” That match was arguably their most energy-sapping of them all so far in the tournament and Hjulmand had actually preferred to play the Netherlands because of the Czechs’ intensity and work-rate. The Danes looked tired after the game, certainly much more tired than the English players after their 4-0 victory against Ukraine. Travel It has not been the most punishing schedule for the Danes. They, like England, played all their group games at home and even the last-16 game did not feature a long trip as it was played in Amsterdam. However, a quarter-final in Baku has not helped the team as they now need to get back to Denmark before flying to London for the semi-final on Wednesday."
article81,Denmark would be a disastrous model for Scotland | Letter,2021-04-20 16:43:22,"['Denmark', 'Scotland', 'Scottish independence', 'Race', 'Scottish politics']","One can only hope that the answer to Ian Jack’s question – “When will Scotland be like Denmark?” – is “never” (An independent Scotland could turn to Denmark for inspiration, 17 April). The perception that Danish people “pay more tax to live more equally [and] happily” may be common, but in reality how “equally” or “happily” depends on whether the Danes in question are lucky enough to be classified favourably by the Danish government. Denmark has issued artificial categorisations of “background”, with “western” including Australia and New Zealand, and those of “non-western background” including Danish-born descendants. “Non-western background” is the determining factor in Denmark’s designation of certain areas as “ghettoes”, which are subjected to special laws, leading to evictions across the country. The UN and other bodies have described Denmark’s actions as discriminatory, stigmatising and marginalising. Undeterred, the minister of interior and housing has unveiled a new proposal that aims to regulate further those of “non-western background”, limiting them to 30% in any “housing estate”. From local ordinances about mandatory pork meatballs to a ban on the veil and the “ghetto package” laws, Denmark has long explicitly targeted those whose religious values and other norms differ from those of the white majority. In contrast, in 2019, all of Scotland’s political parties adopted a formal definition recognising Islamophobia as racism targeting “Muslimness”. Rather than being “worth the wait”, looking to a romanticised and outdated notion of Danish society as egalitarian would be a disastrous step for Scotland, independent or otherwise.

article82,Real Madrid agree €100m deal to sign Aurelién Tchouaméni from Monaco,2022-06-07 14:12:04,"['Real Madrid', 'Monaco', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Transfer window']","Real Madrid have agreed a €100m (£85.3m) deal to sign the defensive midfielder Aurelién Tchouaméni from Monaco. The European champions are to pay a guaranteed €80m for the 22-year-old with the rest in add-ons. Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain are among other teams who pursued the France international. Jürgen Klopp called Tchouaméni in the hope of convincing him to move to Anfield but the player was interested only in Madrid. PSG walked away from negotiations last Friday on that basis, having been ready to pay the highest fee with a guaranteed €100m. Madrid made a breakthrough in talks with Monaco on Monday night and have agreed a contract with Tchouaméni to 2027. That has been in place since just before the Champions League final. Tchouaméni, who played for Bordeaux before joining Monaco in January 2020 for about £16m, is the latest player bought by Madrid to freshen a brilliant but ageing midfield. The defensive midfielder Casemiro is 30, Luka Modric 36 and Toni Kroos 32. Tchouaméni joins his 19-year-old France colleague Eduardo Camavinga at the Bernabéu. Confirmation of a new one-year deal for Modric is scheduled to be announced on Wednesday. Monaco’s sale of Tchouaméni comes four years after they received €180m for Kylian Mbappé from PSG. They have also sold Thomas Lemar, Fabinho, Youri Tielemans, Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy in deals each worth €45m or more since 2017."

article84,Denmark to drop AstraZeneca jab from Covid programme,2021-04-14 16:48:00,"['Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Denmark', 'Europe', 'AstraZeneca', 'World news', 'Society', 'Health']","Denmark will no longer offer the AstraZeneca vaccine as part of its immunisation programme, becoming the first country to drop the vaccine over suspected rare but serious side-effects. The move comes in spite of strong recommendations from the World Health Organization and European medicines watchdog to continue using the inoculation, as the benefits far outweigh any potential risk. “Denmark’s vaccination campaign will go ahead without the AstraZeneca vaccine,” the director of the Danish health authority, Søren Brostrøm, told a press conference. Neighbouring Sweden has said it plans to pause its own roll-out of a second vaccine, produced by Johnson &amp; Johnson, which has also been linked to rare blood clots. Finland also announced that it would continue to limit the AstraZeneca vaccine to people aged 65 and over, adding that it was possible to give a second dose from another manufacturer and that it was drafting a plan on how to continue with its vaccinations. Denmark’s decision comes amid a continuing focus on rare side-effects that has seen the US-produced Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine paused in the US over similar concerns, potentially putting back the EU’s vaccination effort by several months as it waits for supplies. An advisory committee to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was due to meet on Wednesday to review the six clotting cases and vote on recommendations for future use of the shot. The Food and Drug Administration will review the analysis. All six cases involved women between the ages of 18 and 48, with symptoms occurring six to 13 days after vaccination. The FDA said patients should watch for up to three weeks for symptoms including severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath. Experts said clotting risks for both vaccines remained extremely low and that vaccines were highly effective in providing protection against Covid-19. There are concerns that reports of rare side-effects could deter people from getting their shots. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due to issue guidance on Johnson &amp; Johnson next week after US federal health agencies recommended pausing use of the vaccine for at least a few days after six women under age of 50 developed blood clots following their inoculations. Regarding AstraZeneca the European regulator found the benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks and left it to individual states to make their own assessments and decide how administer the vaccine based on local conditions, which vary widely across the bloc. Brostrøm said last month that Denmark had “followed a precautionary principle” with regards to the AstraZeneca vaccine before this week’s decision not to use it. Denmark was the first country in Europe to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca jab in its vaccination rollout, after reports of rare but serious cases of blood clots among those that had received the vaccine. More than a dozen countries followed suit, but all but a few have since resumed its use after the EMA emphasised the benefits of the vaccine and deemed it “safe and effective”. As of April 4, the European Medicines Agency had received reports of 169 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after 34m AstraZeneca doses had been administered in the European Economic Area. In Denmark, two cases of thrombosis, one of which was fatal, were linked to vaccinations after more than 140,000 people received the jab made by the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker. In the country of 5.8 million inhabitants, 8 percent have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and 17 percent have received the first dose. Although deliveries of the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot had barely begun in Europe, questions about the two vaccines threaten to undermine public confidence in the low-cost jabs, which authorities had been counting on as a central weapon in fighting the pandemic. The potential risk of blood clots from some vaccines has prompted different responses across Europe: French government spokesman Gabriel Attal told a news conference on Wednesday that Paris retained confidence in the AstraZeneca shot and would deploy the first doses of the newly arrived Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. The suspension of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine could delay efforts to inoculate most people in the European Union by more than two months, scientific information and analytics company Airfinity said. “If the EU can’t use the J&amp;J vaccine indefinitely, it could push the timeline for vaccinating 75% of the population back into December,” Airfinity said in a forecast update."

Kasper Dolberg speaks: ““He’s an exquisite player,” he says of Mikkel Damsgaard. “He has a good eye for his team-mates, and as a forward you can’t wish for more.” Italy v Austria: Having got off to a flier in ther group stages, Italy host Austria in today’s other Round of 16 match at Wembley Stadium. Kick-off is at 8pm (BST) and Scott Murray has the team news and build-up. Ben Fisher was at the Johan Cruyff Arena to see an impressive Denmark side advance at the expense of out-of-sorts Wales. This is how he saw the action unfold ... Asked by the BBC’s reporter if this was his last game for Wales, Bale just walks away from the microphone and abandons his post-match interview. “It’s not how we wanted the game to go,” he says. “From our point of view we started very well in the first 25 minutes. We c a goal and the game changed a little bit, I think. We came out second half trying to play and unfortunately made a mistake, conceded the goal. “I guess that killed the momentum on our side and obviously to finish the game how we did is disappointing. But the boys were frustrated and angry, so it’s understandable. I’d rather us going out like that, kicking and screaming, than laying off and doing nothing.” Denmark’s players celebrate in front of their fans. Elsewhere on the pitch the Wales players, subs and staff form a wide huddle, with Gareth Bale standing in the middle giving them a pep-talk. They were hammered today, even if Denmark didn’t get their final two goals until the knockings of this game. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeep! It’s all over and Denmark advance to the quarter-finals as thoroughly deserving winners over Wales, who were bossed in pretty much every department. Their interest in Euro 2020 is over and Denmark march onwards. The goal stands! A long check reveals that Chris Mepham was playing Braithwaite onside as he received a cushioned pass before spanking a low diagonal effort into the bottom corner. 90+4 min: Martin Braithwaite has a goal ruled out for offside but there’s a VAR check. He fired into the bottom left hand corner and wheeled away in celebration but the flag went up immediately. 90+3 min: Now Gareth Bale gets booked for the heinous crime of sarcastically applauding the referee. He said he’d announce his decision on his future once Wales went out and predicted it would prompt chaotic scenes. Is he going to retire, I wonder? Oh dear. Wilson gets a straight red for a challenge on - I think - Christensen. It looked a yellow at worst but it doesn’t really matter. 90 min: That was outstanding from Maehle. With the ball at his feet he cut inside from the right and shaped to shoot, sitting Joe Rodon on his backside. He cut inside again to create an angle and smashed the ball into the roof of the net. Game, set and match ... Denmark. Maehle smashes the ball into the roof of net from about eight yards after cutrting inside from the right. 87 min: Barring a miracle, Wales are going out and they can have no complaints. They’ve been completely outplayed tonight and will be disappointed not to have given anywhere near as good an account of themselves as they did in their win over Turkey. 86 min: The corner is taken short, then the ball is curled towards the far post. It’s squared by Cornelius and Braithwaite stretches every sinew but can’t quite steer it goalwards from about a foot out. 84 min: Ramsey gives the ball away to Braithwaite, who sends Maehle on his way up the right wing. Gareth Bale fouls him. Free-kick for Denmark, wide on the right. From that, they win a corner. 82 min: Bale tries to shimmy his way into the Denmark penalty area but has his run blocked. Denmark break upfield and win a corner when Maehle fails to connect with a Braithwaite cross to the near post and the ball goes out off Joe Rodon. 81 min: Braithwaite takes the free-kick and fires the ball over the bar. 79 min: A Ben Davies cross into the Denmark penalty area is cleared by Norgaard. Cornelius breaks up the field and is fouled by Brooks just outside the Wales penalty area. Free-kick for Denmark and a yellow card for Brooks. 77 min: Denmark double-substitution: Nicolai Boilesen and Joachim Andersen on for Jens Sryger Larsen and Simon Kjaer. Kasper Schmeichel takes the captain’s armband. Wales double-substitution: Tyler Roberts and David Brooks on for Kieffer Moore and Dan James. 75 min: Simon Kjaer seems to have done his hamstring a mischief as he stretched to make that tackle. There’s a break in play as he receives treatment. 74 min: Maehle beats Neco Williams on the left side of the Welsh penalty area before rifling a cross with venom. It’s intercepted and Wales break up the field but Simon Kjaer is on hand to put a stop to Gareth Bale’s gallop. 72 min: Denmark are playing keep-ball, the “oles” ringing out around the stands as they pass the ball from side to side halfway inside their own half. 71 min: Less than 20 minutes to go and Wales are looking a little out of ideas, short of slinging crosses into the box towards Kieffer Moore. In the heart of Denmark’s defence, Kjaer and Vestergaard don’t seem unduly concerned by that particular approach. 70 min: Denmark substitution: Andreas Cornelius replaces Denamrk’s two-goal hero Kasper Dolberg, who only started because Yussuf Poulsen is out with a hamstring injury. 68 min: Tottenham team-mates Hjoebjerg and Ben Davies go to ground after a collision. It was a late challenge from the Welshman and Denmark have a free-kick just outside their own penalty area. 68 min: Neco Williams crosses into the Denmark penalty arera but his delivery is too high for Kieffer Moore. 67 min: Cutting in from the right, Joe Allen has a low drive from distance blocked by Jannik Vestergaard. 65 min: Maehle and Mathias Jensen combine down the right and the substitute curls a shot towards the far post. Danny Ward ios beaten and the ball scrapes paint off the outside of the upright. A great effort. 63 min: Joe Allen tries a shot from distance but fires high and wide. 62 min: Aaron Ramsey has an attempted cross into the Denmark penalty area blocked and Simon Kjaer blasts the ball into the stand. 60 min: Denmark double-substituion: Brentford duo Christian Norgaard and Mathias Jensen replace Mikkel Damsgaard and Thomas Delaney. Wales substitution: Harry Wilson on for Joe Morrell. 58 min: Gareth Bale crosses to the far post from the left. Kieffer Moore’s downward header ricochets in the direction of Dan James, whose shot is put out for a corner off Christensen. 56 min: Wales win a free-kick just inside their own half. after a period of passing over and back across the halfway line, the ball’s sent long down the inside left and Simon Kjaer heads clear. 54 min: There was a VAR check in the aftermath of Denmark’s second goal, but only to see if the ball had crossed the line for a throw-in when it was passed to Braithwaite in the build-up. It hadn’t. The obvious foul on Kieffer Moore was ignored. Wales have every right to complain but the fact of the matter is their defending was diabolical. 53 min: Neco Williams loops a cross into the Denmark penalty area and Bale attacks the high ball. He’s unable to control his header and sends the ball wide. 51 min: Maehle stands the ball up for Damsgaard near the penalty spot and he attempts to chest it down. Wales clear. Braithwaite gets another cross in from the right and Neco Williams heads clear. 49 min: A Dolberg foul on Kieffer Moore goes unpunished in the build-up and Braithwaite canters up the right wing. He squares the ball into the penalty area and Neco Williams hits a woeful clearance straight to the feet of Kasper Dolberg, who slots home. The Welsh players complain about the earlier foul on Moore but the goal stands. Dolberg scores his second to double Denmark’s lead. 47 min: The ball’s floated towards Kieffer Moore, who gets his head to it but can’t control it. On ITV co-comms, Robbie Savage says Wales’s wide players are too wide and their sitting midfielders are too deep, which means Moore is isolated. If he gets a knockdown, there’s nobody on hand to capitalise. 46 min: Bale starts the second half on the left, with Dan James moving to the right. 46 min: Play resumes with Denmark on the ball. There are no changes in personnel on either side. Peep! Wales go in for the break trailing by an excellent Kasper Dolberg goal scored on the 27 minute mark. They’re lucky to be just a goal down, having been completely dominated for all but the opening 10 minutes of this game. Denmark asserted their authority by moving Andreas Christensen out of their back three to play just in front of Kjaer and Vestergaard. 45+1 min: Denmark corner after a Maehle shot from a narrow angle is saved by Ward’s right hand. I’m not sure it was on target but ther Wales goalkeeper couldn’t be sure. Nothing comes of the set piece. 45 min: Maehle gallops down the left flank trying to control the bouncing ball but is dispossessed by Joe Morrell. 42 min: Denmark corner. It’s taken short, the ball’s crossed into the Wales penalty area and cleared. Denmark are in complete control of this game as we approach half-time, which can’t come soon enough for Wales. 40 min: Rather harshly, Kieffer Moore is booked for catching Simon Kjaer with an unintentional elbow as the pair contested a high ball. He’ll miss the quarter-final should Wales overturn their deficit and win this game. Wales substitution: Neco Williams on for Connor Roberts. 39 min: Roberts’ goose is cooked. We won’t be seeing him again this evening. Play resumes with Gareth Bale playing at right-back and Wales temporarily down to 10 men. 38 min: Connor Roberts stretches to keep the ball in play as he tries to run on to a pass down the touchline from deep. He appears to have suffered a groin injury and there’s a welcome break in play for Wales as he receives treatment. 36 min: Wales are all over the place at the moment and have been since going behind. Ward flaps at a Delaney cross under pressure from Vestergaard and is lucky to win a free-kick. 34 min: Denmark throw-in, halfway inside the Wales half. From that they win another, further up the pitch near the corner flag. A brilliant Larsen cross to the near post almost picks out Dolberg but the ball ends up going out for a corner. 32 min: Denmark go close to scoring a second against a clearly rattled Welsh side. Damsgaard picks out Dolberg with a cross from the byline to the near post and the striker tries to flick it goalwards from close range. Ward saves with his feet. 30 min: There was a VAR check for offside in tthe build-up to that goal but it stands. German official Bastien Dankert could find no reason to rule it out in his Nyon bunker. 28 min: That was a terrific goal. After excellent work down the left between Damsgaard and Maehle, the ball came Dolberg’s way in the centre. From about 25 yards out, he curled a low shot around two Welsh defenders and into the bottom right-hand corner. Danny Ward had no chance of getting anywhere near that. Denmark lead! Kasper Dolberg curls a wonderful shot inside the right-hand upright from distance. 25 min: Joe Rodon is booked for a foul on Kasper Dolberg after getting the wrong side of the Denmark striker and complains to the referee upon being cautioned. He was bang to rights. 23 min: Thomas Delaney sends a cropss into the Wales penalty area from the right after getting in behind. He tries to pick out Dolberg at the far post but Connor Roberts heads the ball out for a corner. 21 min: From that corner Denmark win another, the ball going out off Joe Rodon as Simon Kjaer tried to steer it goalwards. Kieffer Moore heads this inswinger clear. 19 min: Denmark win themselves a corner. Jens Stryger Larsen raises his right hand and sends the ball towards the far post, where Christensen wins another corner off Mepham. 18 min: Dan James cuts inside from the left and unleashes a low shot. It takes a little deflection on its way into the arms of Kasper Schmeichel, but doesn’t trouble the goalkeeper unduly. 17 min: Thomas Delaney passes the ball out of play, giving Wales a throw-in halfway inside the Denmark half. Nothing comes of it. 16 min: Braithwaite shoves Ben Davies off his feet on the edge of the Wales six-yard box. Free-kick for Wales. 15 min: Bale canters down the right and stabs the ball across the edge of the Denmark penalty area with the outside of his left foot. Aaron Ramsey’s shot takes a deflection into the arms of Kasper Schmeichel. Wales are in the ascendency here. 13 min: Hjoebjerg goes to ground holding his hip after a collision with Kieffer Moore. He’s OK. 12 min: A low drive from Bale, from about 30 yards out, sails a few feet wide of the left upright. 11 min: Aaron Ramsey collects a James cross from the left and shoots twice in quick succession from about 10 yards out. Both efforts meet a wall of Danish resistance. 10 min: Bale sends a shot drifting wide of the far upright after Dan James had made room for him to shoot with a smart decoy run. It was a left-footed effort from Bale after cutting inside from the right but he didn’t get enough curl on it. 9 min: Bale beats Maehle and Vestergaard down the right touchline and sends a cross deep into the Denmark penalty area. It’s cleared. 8 min: Kasper Dolberg turns and shoots from distance after riding a challenge from Joe Rodon a few yards outside the Wales penalty area. It’s ridiculously high and wide. 7 min: Joe Morrell clears a Martin Braithwaite cross into the Wales penalty area before Pierre Emile Hjoebjerg can control it on the edge of the box. 6 min: Denmark win a free-kick deep inside their own half for a Joe Morrell foul on Mikkel Damsgaard. He cleaved through the back of the Danish winger. 5 min: Dan James curls the ball into the mixer, where Martin Braithwaite clears. 4 min: Free-kick for Wales, wide on the right. Dan James curls a low ball into the penalty area and it’s put out for a corner. 4 min: Wales launch their first attack of note but Dan James is unable to prevent a pass from Bale from going out of play for a Danish throw-in. 2 min: A very positive start from Denmark. Thomas Delaney has an attempted cross into the Wales penalty area blocked. In a nice touch from Wales, Gareth Bale presented Denmark skipper Simon Kjaer with a framed Wales shirt that had “Eriksen 10” printed on the back. 1 min: Chris Mepham slides in to dispossess Martin Braithwaite as he canters down the right wing chasing a through ball. 1 min: Wales get the ball rolling, their players wearing red shirts, shorts and socks. The players of Denmark wear all white. Not long now: Referee Daniel Siebert leads the teams out, Wales arriving first, followed in close order by Denmark. Both sets of players line up either side of the match officials and prepare to belt out their national anthems. Kick-off is just a five minutes away. A tale of two City ... goalkeepers: Kasper Schmeichel and Danny Ward will become the first two Leicester City goalkeepers to face each other in the knockout stages of a major international tournament this evening. Ward is very much the understudy at the King Power Stadium, having watched Schmeichel play 114 consecutive Premier League games since he joined the club from Liverpool three years ago. He only played five games for Leicester last season but has acquitted himself every well since becoming Robert Page’s No1 for Wales in this tournament. Those teams: There are two changes to the Denmark team that trounced Russia in Copenhagen. Kasper Dolberg comes in for Yussef Poulsen up front, while Jens Stryger Larsen replaces Daniel Wass at right wing-back. Neither Poulsen nor Wass are in the matchday squad. Robert Page makes three changes. Ben Davies, Chris Mepham and Kieffer Moore return to the starting line-up, with Neco Williams, Chris Gunter and the suspended Ethan Ampadu making way. Wales (4-2-3-1): Ward; Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Davies; Morrell, Allen; Bale, Ramsey, James; Moore. Denmark (3-4-3): Schmeichel; Christensen, Kjaer, Vestergaard; Larsen, Hoejbjerg, Delaney, Maehle; Braithwaite, Dolberg, Damsgaard. Elis James writes ... The professional Welshman and award-winning comedian, podcaster, TV and radio presenter, Swansea City fan and boulevardier about Carmarthen town has taken on far too much work during these Euros, a state of affairs that has resulted in him having anxiety dreams about meeting the deadline for his painstakingly crafted Guardian columns about his beloved Wales. In his latest epistle, he’s reduced to writing about fridge magnets. Read on ... Robert Page speaks “He wears the armband for a reason,” he said of his captain Gareth Bale. “He’s a model professional, looks after himself and he has a family. He’s great around the changing room, he’s got a great group of friends in here. It’s not about Gareth Bale. It’s about us as a nation and all of us together.” On the state of his squad’s fitness: “Everyone’s fit other than Ethan [Ampadu] for a one-game suspension,” he said. “I’ve known [the team] for a while. We had to tweak things against a very strong Italy team. We’re capable of adapting to a couple of formations and different personnel. We’re ready for a battle, because that’s what it’s going to be. It’s all-out now. The gloves are off. We’re fully ready for it.” Kasper Hjulmand speaks “I have great respect for them and all that they have achieved recently, including that semi-final [in 2016],” said Denmark’s coach, when asked about tonight’s opponents. “It’s a country that supports their national team 100 per cent, and the players are working for each other.” On tonight’s game: “We are very much looking forward to it! After three very emotional matches in Parken [Stadium] – we have great expectations for this tie.” Tonight’s match officials Referee: Daniel Siebert (Germany) Assistant referees: Jan Seidel and Rafael Foltyn (Germany) Fourth official: Ovidiu Hategan (Romania) VAR: Bastien Dankert (Germany) Early team news Having been sent off against Italy, Ethan Ampadu must sit out this game on the Uefa Naughty Step and is the only player unavailable for selection by Robert Page. Murmurings from the Wales camp suggest he may pick the same side that started their opening two games. Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand is without Christian Eriksen, who continues his recovery from cardiac arrest. The Danish coach has an otherwise full squad to choose from. His captain Simon Kjaer had been suffering from an unspecified knock but is expected to be available. The Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam is the venue for the first of the Euro 2020 knockout games and it features two of this tournament’s most popular sides. There seems to be a particularly keen Band of Brothers feel around both today’s squads, the players of Wales apparently having described themselves as a gang of friends on a (booze-free) stag do, while Denmark’s footballers made no shortage of new friends on the back of the dignity and togetherness with which they faced near tragedy in their opening game. While this is Denmark’s first match away from the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, they as good as have home advantage because the famously sunlit uplands of Brexit mean Wales fans aren’t allowed to travel. Kick-off in Amsterdam is at 5pm (BST) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."
article86,Revealed: devastation that awaits Syrians facing expulsion by Denmark,2021-05-09 05:15:10,"['Refugees', 'Syria', 'Denmark', 'Middle East and north Africa']","Danish authorities say Mesbah Mshleem must take three of his children, the youngest a Danish-born five-year-old, and return to Damascus, to a home that no longer stands, in a neighbourhood destroyed by the war and often shut off to former residents. There is little hope of compensation for those losses. “I do not know what is left to go back to. How can I protect my children there?” says Mshleem, one of more than 100 Syrians living in Denmark who have effectively lost their refugee status. His lawyer had to challenge an order for his five-year-old to leave the country immediately and alone. Denmark has become the first European nation not to renew residency permits for the refugees, claiming some areas of Syria are now safe for families to return to. The decision stunned and terrified Syrians in Denmark, who have many reasons to fear going home. The war is still raging in parts of Syria, which authorities in Copenhagen have tacitly recognised by giving political asylum to all men whose age would make them vulnerable to forced conscription. This has protected Mshleem’s two oldest boys, 19-year-old twins, from losing their refugee status. The feared Syrian police apparatus, which helped spur the 2011 uprising against Assad, and tortured and murdered throughout the war, is still thriving. The economy is in free fall, making it hard for returnees, who are generally considered politically suspect, to find work or feed their family. For the many Syrians who fled from opposition strongholds around the capital, there is another pressing reason not to return. The war and actions by the Syrian state have effectively rendered them homeless – through demolition and redevelopment plans for Damascus neighbourhoods where they once lived. “We characterise the demolition of these properties as a war crime, because we’re still in a conflict setting, and there’s no apparent legitimate military purpose for the demolition, especially because these areas have been retaken by the government,” said Sara Kayyali, Syria researcher at Human Rights Watch. It is impossible to judge the scale of structural damage from images of buildings that are still standing, and unexploded bombs or mines can be hidden from view. But the Syrian government has not tackled properties individually, or sought the expertise of de-mining experts, including at the United Nations, who could manage a more targeted removal of dangerous buildings and ordnance left behind by fighting. “To destroy entire buildings at such a large scale in an above surface demolition is disproportionate for a de-mining effort,” Kayyali said. Um Alaa, a former driving instructor who has applied to work at a hospice in Denmark, had a home in Qaboun, an area affected by one of the most comprehensive demolition programmes. The area is next to Jobar where Mshleem’s house stood. “I would send the kids to my family’s while my husband and I carried stones around with our bare hands. We could not hire workers to help us, so we did everything by ourselves,” she remembers. For years they poured all their money into their home. “The rooftop was turned into a beautiful terrace, with a marble, Damascene-style fountain in the middle, as well as plants and flowers,” she remembered. They were expanding the second floor for her son when they left. The house survived years of intense fighting; a photo sent by a relative shortly before the government recaptured the neighbourhood in May 2017 showed it still standing. But the area around it was flattened by a blast between 13 and 18 September that year; Syrian state media reported a controlled explosion in the area on 14 September. Um Alaa’s residence permit in Denmark is of the kind now being rejected for renewal, and she fears that next year she too will be asked to return a place where she no longer has a home or a community. Satellite photos show almost half of the prewar buildings in Qaboun have now been entirely razed, and many others badly damaged. Even surviving buildings are empty because the area is sealed off on security grounds. Draft plans suggest the government wants reconstruction to transform an informal, relatively poor neighbourhood into a playground for the wealthy, with high-rise residential towers, investment properties and a mall. Many Qaboun residents like Um Alaa found their homes demolished with no warning or offer of compensation. Former residents in other areas have been offered shares in future developments, but the speculative tokens are unlikely to be enough to cover an apartment. While refugees have no guaranteed right to return to their original home, their property rights should be respected under international law, said Mohammad al-Abdallah executive director of the Syrian Justice and Accountability Centre. “Countries should be considered unsuitable for returnees when a refugee’s home or neighbourhood is destroyed, as is the case for many Syrians from greater Damascus, unless a property restitution framework has been established that appropriately compensates for destruction of property. Such a framework does not exist in Syria, despite the government’s promises, and is another reason why refugees should not be forcibly returned.” Finding housing is therefore extremely hard, Kayyali said. The economic crisis can make it hard to earn money for rent, there is a scarcity of housing because of the war, and all contracts need approval from the security services. “To rent or buy house in Syria, you need the security services to clear it, which is a difficult process at best. And for those people who are returning it’s just untenable to engage with the various security services to this extent.” Since Copenhagen does not have diplomatic relations with Damascus it cannot directly deport people to Syria. At least some of the rejected applicants have been placed in a departure centre, which campaigners said amounted to a prison where residents could not work, study or get proper healthcare. Mesbah is trying to stay out of these centres as they appeal against their order to leave, and because the children are still grieving for their mother, who died of cancer last year. “Losing her was difficult for our family. The children ask to visit their mother’s grave every now and then. They go there and talk to her.” The news organisations Lighthouse Reports and Rozana contributed to this story"
article87,‘He’s become a friend’ – how Kasper Hjulmand led Denmark through crisis | Marcus Christenson,2021-06-25 15:50:09,"['Denmark', 'Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","He wasn’t even supposed to be in charge. If the pandemic had not happened, Kasper Hjulmand would have been watching Euro 2020 in the stands, taking notes and preparing to replace Åge Hareide as Denmark coach after the tournament. As it is, he has presided over the most tumultuous fortnight in the history of Danish football – and become a leader not only for the team but the whole country. No one could have prepared Hjulmand for what happened against Finland on 12 June when Christian Eriksen had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated on the pitch. It was a huge emotional drama but the 49-year-old has steered his players through it all with a remarkable degree of sensitivity and dignity. Hjulmand had a special bond with Eriksen, who is recovering at home, and has repeatedly talked about what a great person the Internazionale playmaker is, as well as a fantastic footballer. The incident hit the coach hard but the way he responded has increased the support he has among the players. After Denmark, who face Wales in the Euro 2020 last 16 in Amsterdam on Saturday, had beaten Russia 4-1 to secure progress from group B the captain, Kasper Schmeichel, said: “The players are rightly getting a lot of praise but there is one person we shouldn’t forget and that is Kasper Hjulmand.” Known in Denmark to be a bit of a “football nerd” Hjulmand has transcended that perception in the past two weeks. “Kasper has been incredible in the way he has handled all of it, having focus on the fact that we shall continue to play football but that different people were in different places mentally,” the defender Simon Kjær told BT. “At the same time he had to deal with himself [and his feelings]. He has been a fantastic coach and leader for the team. I am very grateful I have him as my coach.” Hjulmand had to end his football career as a 26-year-old after no fewer than nine knee operations but was soon making a name for himself in coaching. Having started at Lyngby he joined Nordsjælland as assistant coach in 2008 before being promoted to head coach three years later. He won the club their first Danish championship in 2012 before trying his luck in Germany, replacing Thomas Tuchel at Mainz at the start of the 2014-15 season. The spell in Germany did not go to plan, Hjulmand lasting only seven months before returning to Denmark. At the time he and his family were shaken by an incident at the home for individuals with learning disabilities where his brother, Simon, was living. A person at the home died after being restrained by staff and it had a profound effect on Hjulmand. “The next job has to be in Scandinavia,” he said in the biography Football Dreams, written by Morten Glinvand. Hjulmand also joined a campaign to ensure that there was better care for disabled people in Denmark. “It is time that we focus on the situation for disabled people in Denmark,” he said. “Denmark have signed up to the UN’s convention on the rights of persons with disabilities to ensure that everyone in Denmark, notwithstanding which disability they have, have the same possibilities to live a meaningful life.” He was a controversial choice as Denmark coach when given the job in 2019, to take over a year later. He was seen as a football romantic, a lover of Barcelona and Johan Cruyff, whereas his predecessor, the successful Hareide, was more pragmatic. Hjulmand does not believe it is as black and white as that but the team have played some sensational football under him, not least in the first three qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup, beating Israel, Moldova and Austria, scoring 14 and conceding none. The fascinating thing about Hjulmand is that even before the European Championship finals he was talking about creating an identity around the Denmark team. Who were they? How could the rest of the population identify with them? For him it was important to have the nation’s support. “The results are the most important thing,” he said in an interview with Berlingske in June. “If we don’t get results I can sit here between now and Christmas Eve and talk and it wouldn’t matter. I want to give the people hope, where they are proud of the boys who are playing for the national team and that they can identify with them. They are role models and they accept that role. “And that doesn’t just happen by accident; we can work on that because of the personalities that are in this team. We are going to have their identities in our play, their willingness to give everything they have, show who they are, show who we are. I hope a lot of people will be behind us. These players are burning madly for the national team.” That has been clear in the past two weeks with Hjulmand at the forefront. “He has been very important,” says the defender Joakim Mæhle. “He is good at talking with the player and giving that freedom that many players need. He also showed his feeling after what happened with Christian and that he needed help too. What we have been through has just brought us closer together. He is a good coach and now a friend for us too.” It is with that togetherness Denmark take on Wales. It is a formidable force for a team on an adventure they do not want to end. “We have been fortunate to have had the group stage in Denmark,” Hjulmand said this week. “I hope we are back at our training camp at Helsingør on Sunday preparing for a quarter-final.”"
article88,"Westerners in no mood for concessions to Russia in Ukraine, poll finds",2022-10-14 12:27:18,"['Russia', 'Ukraine', 'World news', 'Europe']","Nearly eight months into Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, citizens in core western alliance countries show little appetite for the kind of concessions to Russia that might form part of an eventual agreement to end the fighting, according to a major survey. The YouGov-Cambridge globalism project, which gauged public opinion in 25 of the world’s largest countries, also found strong support for maintaining, and often toughening and expanding, military and economic measures against Moscow. But while the survey found respondents in most western nations in an uncompromising mood, multiple countries around the world – including some in the west – were markedly more ambivalent, or even sympathetic, towards Russia. “If Putin is counting on waning western resolve, this research suggests more bad news for his beleaguered military campaign,” said Joel Rogers de Waal, YouGov’s academic director. “But it’s not an international consensus.” The polling, between 24 August and 22 September, found that of 13 western or anglophone countries – France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Poland, the UK, US, Australia and Canada – a “core group” of 10 backed maintaining economic sanctions on Russia. Greece, Hungary and Italy were outliers. Among the remaining 10 countries, support for sanctions ranged from a low of 57% or 58% in France and Germany, through 60%, 62% and 65% in Canada, the US and Poland, to highs of more than 70% in the UK, Sweden and Denmark. In those same 10 countries, significant numbers – 62% in Poland, 57% in Sweden, 50% in the UK, 40-50% in France, Germany, Spain and the US – also felt existing sanctions were “not harsh enough” and should be strengthened. Many western voters were willing to pay a price for this, with about half or more – 66% in Denmark, 63% in the UK – favouring sanctions even if their living costs increased slightly (support dipped if a “large increase” was implied, but by no more than about 10 points). Militarily, there was substantial backing for Nato aid to Ukraine’s forces, including the supply of arms, intelligence and out-of-country training; cyber and information warfare aimed at the Russian government; and even for military advisers inside Ukraine (as long as they stayed out of the fighting). A majority in all 10 core western countries also favoured deploying non-violent “hybrid warfare” measures, such as targeting Russian media with alternative information – but there was little core western support (30-40% in most countries, falling to just 20% in Germany) for direct Nato military involvement. “For all the public noise this year about the dangers of global nuclear catastrophe erupting from the war, a lot of western voters are undaunted in their view that Nato should continue sustaining the Ukrainian war effort,” Rogers de Waal said. Perhaps most intriguingly, most western respondents showed little appetite for much – if any – compromise with the Kremlin over how the conflict might end. The survey asked whether they would support various concessions to Moscow – an end to sanctions, Russian sovereignty over Crimea, independence for Donetsk and Luhansk, and a guarantee that Ukraine would not join Nato – if Russia agreed to stop fighting and to give up all, most, some or none of its Ukrainian territorial gains. “What’s striking is how generally low the level of support is for giving concessions to Russia in any of those scenarios – and how the difference between Russia relinquishing all of its newly occupied Ukrainian territory and none makes only a limited difference to the overall result,” Rogers de Waal said. Only 13% of respondents in France, for example, backed recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea if Moscow gave up none of its new Ukrainian territory – but the percentage was not very different (17%) if it surrendered all of it. In Germany, the corresponding figures were 20% for “all” and 17% for “none”; in Sweden 13% and 10%, in Spain 18% and 16%; Poland 12% and 11%, Britain 10% and 6% and the US 15% and 13%. Three European countries were consistent exceptions in the west. Asked whether Nato was doing too much to help Ukraine, only 7% in Denmark, Poland and the UK answered yes – but the figures in Italy, Greece and Hungary were 22%, 23% and 31%. At 37% and 32%, support in Greece and Hungary for maintaining sanctions on Russia was half some western countries, while barely a fifth of Greek and Hungarian respondents backed Nato sending heavy weapons to Ukraine, against 44% in France, 57% in the UK and 65% in Poland. Italy often fell between Hungary and Greece, on the one hand, and the core western bloc on the other. Similarly, Greece, Hungary and Italy were significantly more likely to favour concessions to Russia: for example, 31% of respondents in Greece, 28% in Hungary and 23% in Italy favoured recognising Russian sovereignty over Crimea even if Russia gave up none of its new Ukrainian territory, against 8% in Denmark and 6% in the UK. Beyond the west – the survey also covered Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa – many other countries were markedly more pro-Russian. For example, only about 35% of respondents backed economic sanctions in Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Thailand, and barely a third in Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia supported Nato sending heavy weapons to Ukraine. The propaganda war Only minorities in 25 countries around the world – ranging from 3%-6% in the UK and Spain to 22% in India and 23% in Saudi Arabia – believe the world would be a safer place if Russia achieved its aims in Ukraine. In the west, most respondents overwhelmingly rejected the narrative spun by Moscow to justify its invasion of Ukraine and broadly accepted the alliance view of what was causing the war, the YouGov-Cambridge study found. “If the Kremlin has failed to achieve its original military aims on the ground in Ukraine, so it has also struggled to prevail in the wider information war to define the causes of and justifications for the conflict,” Rogers de Waal said. In the same 10 core western countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, Sweden and Poland, barely 20% – and just 8% in the UK – said they believed Russia’s line that the invasion aimed to protect ethnic Russians from genocide. Similarly low numbers accepted another Russian argument, that Ukraine had fallen under the influence of nazism, with slightly more – but generally less than 25% – believing Moscow’s claim that the west had tried use Ukraine as a base to threaten Russia. Among the core 10, the western view that Russia had invaded because Putin did not view Ukraine as a proper country, and that the war was driven by Russian imperialism and a desire to increase Russia’s global status, was backed by 65%-79%. Again, however, Greece, Hungary and to a lesser extent Italy were notable exceptions in Europe, with 43% of Greeks believing Kyiv was in the grip of Nazi sympathisers and 41% of Hungarians saying the west had sought to threaten Russia from Ukraine. Several countries in the Middle East and Africa, including Turkey, reflected similar beliefs – although, significantly, all 25 countries around the world showed strong, generally majority support for the view that it was Russian imperialism and status that lay behind the war. On the key question of whether Russia was more to blame than the west, responses followed broadly the same pattern, with strong majorities in the core western alliance (up to 78% in Sweden, Denmark and the UK) blaming Russia, and correspondingly very low numbers (4% in Poland, 6% in Spain, 7% in France) blaming the west. In Greece and Hungary, however, only 37% and 35% said Russia was more to blame, although those percentages were still greater than those pointing the finger at the west. Outside the west, the numbers saying Russia bore responsibility for starting for the war were also lower: 23% in Egypt, for example, 26% in Turkey, 34% in Thailand, 44% in Nigeria. But, tellingly, of all the 25 countries surveyed, only in Saudi Arabia, India and Indonesia did more respondents (24%, 28% and 26%) believe that the west was more to blame for the war in Ukraine than was Russia (23%, 27% and 15%)."
article89,Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand: ‘I can’t praise my players enough’,2021-06-12 20:58:56,"['Christian Eriksen', 'Denmark', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Euro 2020', 'Finland', 'European Championship']","The Denmark coach, Kasper Hjulmand, paid tribute to his players after they completed their Euro 2020 group match against Finland despite witnessing Christian Eriksen being given CPR on the pitch shortly before half-time. The players formed a protective circle around their teammate as he was resuscitated, but then, after a suspension of more than an hour and half, agreed to complete the match, once word had come through that Eriksen was awake and talking in hospital. “It was a tough night,” Hjulmand said. “We are all reminded what the most important thing in life is and that is to have valuable relations. We have a group of players I can’t praise enough. I couldn’t be prouder of these people who take such good care of each other at such a time where one of my very, very dear friends is suffering.” Hjulmand described how the players agreed to wait until they were sure Eriksen was OK, and then chose between the two options they were offered: either to carry on or to return on Sunday at 2pm. “There was no pressure from Uefa to play tonight,” he said. “We knew we had two options. The players couldn’t imagine not being able to sleep tonight and then having to get on the bus and come in again tomorrow. Honestly it was best to get it over with. Of course you can’t play a game with such feelings and what we tried to do was incredible.” The national team doctor, Morten Boesen, was one of those who tended to the player on the pitch. “I didn’t see it myself but it was pretty clear that he was unconscious,” he said. “When I get to him he is on his side. He is breathing and I can feel his pulse but suddenly that changes and as everyone saw, we started giving him CPR. “Help came really, really fast from the medical team and the rest of the staff and with their cooperation we did what we had to do. We managed to get Christian back. He spoke to me before he was taken to the hospital for more analysis.” Denmark lost the game 1-0, but that was far from being a concern. “All of our thoughts and prayers are with Christian and his family right now,” said Hjulmand. “Christian is one of our best players and he’s an even better person, so all my thoughts and all my positive energy go out to Christian.” The Danish football federation director Peter Møller said the players had spoken to Eriksen and were “playing the match for Christian”. Hjulmand outlined the toll the events had taken on his squad. “There are players in there who are completely emotionally finished ... they are holding each other,” he said, struggling to hold back tears. “It was a traumatic experience. I said that, no matter what, everything was OK. “We had to allow ourselves to show joy and aggression, to make room for the emotions. You cannot play a football match at this level without being aggressive.” Hjulmand revealed that the captain Simon Kjær, a close friend of Eriksen’s, had to be withdrawn after the restart. “Simon was deeply, deeply affected,” he said. “Deeply affected. He was in doubt whether he could continue and gave it a shot, but it could not be done.” Denmark next face Belgium on Thursday in Copenhagen. “There is the opportunity to get help,” Hjulmand said. “We are trying to pick ourselves up now and get ourselves sorted as much as we can. We have professionals with us. We will talk about it tonight, try to process it and move on together.”"
article90,Dolberg and Delaney send Denmark past Czechs and into semi-finals,2021-07-03 18:02:11,"['Euro 2020', 'Denmark', 'Czech Republic', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","It is not how you start, it is how you finish. At least it is for Denmark, whose tournament began traumatically but who are now pursuing a happy ending with a skill and resolve that may just take them all the way. They will certainly be fierce adversaries in Wednesday’s semi-final. The Czech Republic, on the other hand, go home lamenting the fact that their second-half improvement in this quarter-final, which yielded a goal by Patrik Schick, was not enough to offset a wayward first half. Thomas Delaney scored after five minutes and Kasper Dolberg struck just before the interval to establish a lead that proved insurmountable. Denmark have already achieved one extraordinary European triumph in their history; glory this year, after the ordeal of Christian Eriksen’s cardiac arrest and defeat in their first two matches, would be even more remarkable than the country’s success in 1992. Denmark’s manager, Kasper Hjulmand, was a budding player back then and has told of how he turned down Euro 92 final tickets so that he could enjoy a romantic weekend away with his then girlfriend. That must have gone well, since nearly 30 years later the couple are still together. And now Hjulmand has a date with England for a chance to complete a story that would be hard not to love. Hjulmand said before the quarter-final that he would rather have faced the Netherlands than the Czechs because Jaroslav Silhavy’s side were the first opponents in the tournament whom he thought could match Denmark’s intensity. He was happy to be proved wrong about that as early as the fifth minute, when Delaney put Denmark in front in a very unexpected way. Set pieces are supposed to be a particular strength of the Czech Republic but their feeble defending at a corner enabled the Danes to take the lead. Delaney was left alone near the penalty spot to guide a downward header into the net following Jens Stryger Larsen’s outswinging delivery. For a team that had conceded only two goals in the tournament prior to that, it was an enraging way to fall behind. It was 11 minutes before the Czechs threatened at the other end, with Schick jinking in from the right to dispatch a shot that was deflected wide. That was about the extent of Schick’s involvement in a first half in which Denmark cut off the supply to him with surprising ease. Soon after Schick’s chance Denmark penetrated the Czech defence again in straightforward style. Mikkel Damsgaard ran on to a long ball from the back and flipped it past the advancing goalkeeper, but not with enough power to prevent the backtracking Vladimir Coufal from clearing. The Czechs were unusually sluggish and Delaney could have punished them again when he ran unnoticed into the box to meet a cross from the right in the 17th minute. He scuffed his shot wide. Slowly the Czechs improved but it took a misplaced clearance by Schmeichel to give them their next chance and the keeper made amends by blocking Tomas Holes’ shot. Two minutes later Tomas Soucek headed wide from a corner, one of several that the Czechs forced in the first half. Denmark defended most of them well, and looked for opportunities to counterattack. Jan Boril gave them one in the 38th minute when he lost the ball in midfield but the break ended with Tomas Vaclik batting away Damsgaard’s shot from 15 yards. Vaclik was helpless a few minutes later when Joakim Mæhle supplied a sumptuous cross from the left with the outside of his right foot. Dolberg arrived at speed to apply the finish that such high-class service deserved, steering a sidefooted volley into the net from six yards. The Czechs had to come up with a new plan at half-time. To their credit they did. Michael Krmencik, one of two substitutions introduced for the start of the second half as Silhavy shifted to a 4-4-2, fired off a shot within seconds of his introduction and then helped to create a chance for Antonin Barak, whose shot from 18 yards drew a smart save from Schmeichel. The Czechs attacked with more vigour and fluency and soon they halved the Danes’ lead. Their goal came from a cross from the right by Coufal and was finished with typical expertise by Schick, who guided the ball first time past Schmeichel from 12 yards. That drew the striker level with Cristiano Ronaldo in this tournament’s scoring charts and brought the Czechs right back into a contest that had seemed to be passing them by. Suddenly Denmark needed to rethink. Hjulmand concocted a solution, making a double change of his own before the hour to stem the ominous flow. The new duo, Yussuf Poulsen and Christian Nørgaard, reinvigorated the Danish attack. Vaclik twice stopped Poulsen from making it 3-1. The pace dropped as tiredness took its toll on both teams. Czech comeback hopes sagged when Schick went off clutching his hamstring. Mæhle remained as perky as ever and would have wrapped up victory in the 82nd minute if not for another save by Vaclik. No matter, Denmark never really looked like letting their lead slip. This is a team with plenty of quality and a resilience that no one can doubt."
article91,Euro 2020: Denmark plan Eriksen tribute against Belgium – as it happened,2021-06-17 11:56:15,"['Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","Right, that’s your lot for Thursday’s Euro 2020-excitement blog. Thank you for reading, commenting, tweeting, and everything else. Niall McVeigh has ridden over the horizon with the liveblog for Ukraine v North Macedonia - follow it here - Bye for now. Former Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre to ... Crystal Palace? Ed Aarons reports: Tyrone Mings, the England defender, has spoken to the media today ahead of the Scotland match. In the wake of Christian Eriksen’s cardiac arrest, he was asked if he thinks the players’ health is being sufficiently protected: “First things first, it’s a huge relief that he’s OK,” Mings said. “It was very distressing for all involved, and all who saw it ... We couldn’t be in a safer place than on the pitch - had it been somewhere else, maybe he wouldn’t have been so fortunate. We are lucky to have that kind of treatment available. “Off the pitch, there are a lot of tests and scans ... for players it puts into perspective what is important, and what isn’t ... I’m sure everybody went through a bit of reflection. In terms of our wellbeing, I think we are well looked after.” Has Mings been in contact with his Aston Villa teammate John McGinn before Friday’s match? “Yeah, he texted me the other day just saying well done [after England’s win over Croatia] ... and I wished him all the best for their game ... but not since then, no.” “When Terry Venables used to work with Jimmy Hill, of course they used to battle like mad on the air,” Des Lynam says with a chuckle. “I would sort of just sit back, enjoy it, occasionally toss the firework in and watch it go.” Michael Butler speaks to the smoothest football telly presenter of them all: More non-Euros news: the Fulham manager Scott Parker seems to be getting closer and closer to the exit door at relegated Fulham. “While I still despise the system with every fibre of my being, I have to say that, so far, I have been quite impressed by how unobtrusive VAR has been in the Euros. Perhaps the self-proclaimed Best League in the World™ should have a word with the organisers to see how it should really be operated.” A very decent point in one of today’s Fiver letters, from Alistair Moffat. Read Niall McVeigh’s full Fiver right here! John McGinn, speaking to the Scottish FA in a match preview on their official website, looked back to their opening defeat by Czech Republic, and added the players must control their emotions against England: “The gaffer gave us 24 hours after the [Czech Republic] game. The result went against us but as I said post-match we can either sulk about it or roll up our sleeves and get on with it. The task remains the same and that’s what we will be focussing on ... “For us the main message is to treat it like any other game. If we play with too much emotion and passion it may end up going against us or end up with ten men on the park.” We’ve had some live pictures of England’s final pre-match training session courtesy of Sky Sports News. All 26 members of the squad were fit to train. If Harry Maguire is included in the matchday squad, that means three outfield players will be left out entirely. As Jacob Steinberg wrote on Monday, Southgate praised Ben Chilwell and Jadon Sancho for staying upbeat despite being the ones to miss out on any involvement in the opener against Croatia: Will Gareth Southgate unleash Grealish? Karen Carney believes tomorrow night’s Scotland match could be just the right moment for the Aston Villa playmaker to taste some tournament action: Is the Pope Catholic? (#DEVILTIME is Belgium’s official hashtag.) They meet Denmark at 5pm UK time. They’ve even got their players using it: Oh, another post about Italy? Go on then. Locatelli’s second goal against Switzerland last night was rather pretty: The final match on today’s menu will see Perennial Underachievers™ the Netherlands take on Austria at 8pm UK time. Both are coming off opening wins, so another three points for one of these sides, and they will be into the last 16. (This is the only match in ‘round two’ that contested by teams that both won their openers.) The big team news is that the defender Matthijs de Ligt, formerly of Ajax and now with Juventus, will start for the Netherlands. Here are some ‘Matchday Mood’ training photos recently published by Austria’s social media operatives: dacynic looks ahead to tomorrow night at Wembley: “I get the feeling that England are going to have to be right on it to beat the their old friends from across the wall tomorrow. Scotland, having lost their first game, have little to lose. And the possibility of scuppering England’s chances added to the age old rivalry means they are going to be even more up for it than usual.” I agree with that. Scotland weren’t bad at all against Czech Republic, they created plenty, and lost out to a couple of brilliant goals by Schick. If Kieran Tierney is fit to start - which is looking increasingly likely after news that he took full part in training today - that will be another reason to fancy Scotland getting a result. Granted, they will need to be more clinical, and are highly unlikely to have as many sights of goal as they did against Czech Republic, but they have a more than decent chance of doing something special, if you ask me. The Euro 96 nostalgia-a-thon continues. PA have some quotes from Darren Anderton, who says no one remembers the fact that he passed the ball to Gazza for THAT goal against Scotland: “Of course it made me feel great and it does make me laugh because I have had conversations with people,” Anderton said. “I remember someone once said to me, ‘I was at the England v Scotland game, you should have been there, it was unbelievable’. And I just went, ‘Yeah, yeah, I know, I passed him the ball’. I didn’t mean it in a bad way and people just laughed, the poor guy was mortified.” The goal came soon after Scotland won a penalty, about which Anderton said: “First I thought, ‘Oh s**t, what have we done’. We played great, got a really good goal from Alan Shearer and once the penalty is given your thoughts are just déjà vu,” Anderton said. “It was exactly the same as against the Swiss and it was like, ‘Oh my Lord, we are going to get battered’. “Then Dave makes a great save and from the goal-kick the ball went to Teddy, I saw Gazza making his run and I knew Teddy would play it off nice and simple. I played Gazza in and once that ball went into his path it was a bit like slow motion, I thought like everyone else, ‘hit it, hit it’, but he flicked it up in the air and then it was just magical. As it came down in the air you just knew that this was the goal, it was the goal he was dreaming about all summer, for him to score against Andy Goram, one of his best mates, meant a lot to him I am sure. It was just magical and he answered the criticism with his celebration. That is what Gazza is all about, he is a genius.” It was a nice easy starter for Germany against the current world champions, France, on Tuesday. Germany lost 1-0. In two days’ time they will meet the current European champions, Portugal. There are no easy games at this level. There are certainly no easy games in Group F, although Hungary will be like a blast of fresh air for Die Mannschaft after two fiendishly tough opening matches. They need a win on Saturday. Loving this North Macedonia training drill. Ezgjan Alioski will surely be taking it back to Leeds and suggesting it to his club gaffer, Marcelo Bielsa? That’s one of the most ludicrous things I’ve seen on a training field since Tony Adams at Granada: lancaster43 comments with a mini match preview/prediction for the match which kicks off in under three hours: “Ukraine v North Macedonia, coming up at 2pm. High hopes for this one being that bonkers game that every tournament seems to have ... A let’s-forget-defending 4-3 with dozens of other chances missed, or more likely descends into a kicking contest, multiple bookings, three sent off, touchline punch-up, a mini Battle of Santiago and generally things that we are told no one wants to see on a football pitch. No one.” Definitely not, we don’t want to see anything resembling that. Mind you ... they’ll both be desperate to get a result. It’s just got that ring to it - Ukraine v North Macedonia, the match that absolutely no one expected to be amazing, but turned out, actually, to be amazing. ““Why not?” came Connor Roberts’ reply when asked, minutes after his goal had put the knockout stages in view for Wales, whether the team could next pull off the unthinkable: defeat Italy, unbeaten in 29 matches and on a run of 31 unanswered goals, in Rome to top Group A.” Ben Fisher reports from Baku after that stunning win for Wales against Turkey: Let’s think about Belgium. They’re quite good, aren’t they, really? Romelu Lukaku hit the onion bag twice in their opening win against Russia - with a message for his Internazionale teammate Christian Eriksen to boot. But can Belgium pull it all together and build a serious assault on the trophy? To me they feel a bit like Spain pre-2008 - tonnes of talent, all the necessary systems in place, but a lack of ability to really make it all count ... we will know more this evening after their second match, against Denmark, in which it appears Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne will be making an appearance. De Bruyne hasn’t played since suffering a fractured eye socket in last month’s Champions League final. “The programme is very clear for Kevin De Bruyne,” coach Roberto Martinez said yesterday. “He’s medically fit, he has the green light to be in a match situation. Obvious now is the question of seeing how long Kevin can play and how we can use the two games that we have in five days to try to bring him to the 90 minutes. I’m really pleased with the progress that he’s making - every day he makes a big difference.” Here’s the match report from last Saturday: Meanwhile, the Arsenal full-back Kieran Tierney has apparently taken part in full training with Scotland today, so that is really encouraging news with regards to his involvement against England tomorrow. Yesterday, he told Ewan Murray he thinks he is ‘50-50’ to be fit for the big one at Wembley: The Italian journalist currently talking on Sky Sports News, Francesco Cosatti, has an update on Chiellini’s injury: “Today he will be checked by the doctors ... if we are optimistic, we can think about 10 days off.” Another smattering of non-Euros news: Sergio Ramos is leaving Real Madrid. That’s nearly as big as Leo Messi leaving Barcelona (if it ever happens), or Des Walker leaving Forest. The former England international, Kieron Dyer, is talking to Sky Sports News, and is asked about England fans booing while the players took the knee before the opening win against Croatia. “In my opinion it’s a racist act,” he says. “It’s a minority of the fans, but those people don’t want equality for black people. The fans who booed taking the knee, but then jumped on the bandwagon and celebrated when [Raheem] Sterling scored, are hypocrites. They can’t have it both ways.” Well said. On the subject of Italy and Italians ... Gennaro Gattuso OUT at Fiorentina after 22 days: Fiorentina have parted ways with manager Gennaro Gattuso 22 days after announcing his appointment. Gattuso was named Fiorentina’s manager for the 2021-22 season on May 25 after leaving Napoli. The Italian was appointed following Giuseppe Iachini’s departure. Fiorentina did not give a reason for Gattuso’s exit, but reports in the Italian media said the 43-year-old had been in dispute with the club over transfer signings this summer. “ACF Fiorentina and Mister Rino Gattuso, by mutual agreement, have decided not to follow up on the previous agreements and therefore not to start the next football season together,” Fiorentina said in a statement. Gattuso failed to secure Champions League qualification at Napoli last season, with the team finishing fifth, one point behind fourth-placed Juventus. Fiorentina, who finished 13th last campaign, said they will immediately begin their hunt for a new manager. (Reuters) Back into the #AzzurriZone briefly (I reserve the right to keep banging on about Italy), as eprstockholm comments: “Really impressed by Italy so far and though I’m generally fond of them, it’s been really good to see them playing such effervescent attacking football. That said, the quality of opposition has left something to be desired: Turkey have been utterly dreadful in both of their games - a lot of people online hastily amending those “dark horses” tips I suspect - while Switzerland looked hapless against the counters in the second half.” It’ll be interesting to see how Italy v Wales pans out, which is on Sunday. Mancini surely won’t mind the chance to rest a few players, and of course Chiellini has that hamstring niggle after last night, so he surely won’t be involved. There was talk last night (including from Patrick Vieira on ITV) that Italy can’t be judged after beating two poor teams - which is true - but then we can also judge them on their pre-tournament form: they went eight matches without even conceding a goal, a run which has now become 10. Ukraine v North Macedonia, coming up at 2pm, should be spicy. Both sides lost their opening matches: Netherlands snatched a thrilling 3-2 victory against Ukraine while North Macedonia fell 3-1 to Austria. It follows that neither team that runs out at the National Arena in Bucharest in a few hours’ time can afford to lose if they want to stay involved in this summer’s festival of football. We’ve got a couple of great background pieces on North Macedonia - one about Elif Elmas of Napoli, the ‘diamond formed in family sweet shop’, by Vladimir Bulatovic: And another on Goran Pandev, the evergreen striker who scored their first goal of the tournament in that defeat by Austria, by our very own Nick Ames: While we’re on the subject of Pandev, here’s a chucklesome tweet from Rich Jolly from the other day: Our latest round-up of classic YouTube action fittingly features plenty of England v Scotland memories, plus a tribute to the late, great Diego Maradona: Bookmark this: our indispensable one-stop guide to the tournament: England have been kind enough to share their pre-match schedule for today. 11.15am: Final training session 7pm: Media conference 1am: Dentist’s chair Ewan Murray has been speaking to the Scotland midfielder Callum McGregor - who previously spent time playing alongside England’s Jack Grealish at Notts County - and will of course be in the mix to face the old enemy in that seismic Group D meeting tomorrow night. “We linked up really well – Jack set up the majority of the goals I scored. He came in with a reputation even at that age.” We certainly hope you are enjoying all this Euro 2020 coverage: here is Jonathan Liew to explain how the magic happens, and how you can help keep it happening: “Perhaps it would make more commercial sense to litter our webpages with pop-up ads and autoplay videos and make you answer three questions about toothpaste before being able to read anything ... But of course, we aspire to more than that. Moreover, we think you aspire to more than that.” A big shout going out to Jannik Vestergaard from his club, none other than Southampton of the Premier League. Euro 2020 fever is sweeping the nation(s): BjornXII chimes in, in the comments: “Sorry to hijack to BEL and DEN, but Italy look remarkable. Still screaming around in the 90th minute, the midfield is dominant (so far), top 3 look dangerous. Loving them so far.” Si. Here is our story on Christian Eriksen’s treatment following his cardiac arrest, and the news he is to be fitted with a heart starter: Looking ahead to Denmark v Belgium, TheLMachine comments: “As a Belgium fan I don’t really know how to approach this game, part of me wants Belgium to continue on their winning streak and part of me wants Denmark to get the win they deserve. “I certainly won’t hold it against the Belgian players if they decide to go “soft” (although that could be more disrespectful to Denmark than anything else) but that doesn’t seem like it will be the case anyway. “I think i’ll just hope for a nice, entertaining game with no injuries on either side and be quite satisfied if it ends in a draw. Or maybe Belgium will go in full meltdown and lose, you never know ...” FredleBelge agrees: “Won’t go as far as wishing for a Danish win, but a good entertaining game, with a display of fairness and mutual respect would be a lovely tribute to Eriksen.” Cretinsahoppin adds: “Go Denmark, somewhat screwed in Round 1 even though it was something of an impossible position. Let’s be honest asking Eriksen if the game should have been played is as silly as asking Pavard if he was ok to play on. Start looking after the players ffs.” Quite right on both counts: the impact to Pavard’s head was sickening, and it was instantly obvious that he should come off. As for the resumption of Denmark v Finland match, it was astonishing to hear Uefa announce the match would restart that same evening. While the demands on Uefa in running a major tournament must be considered, surely, there had to be a better and fairer way to manage the situation. The subsequent words from Danish players show how poorly they were treated by the governing body. Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen is to be fitted with a heart starter, the national team doctor has confirmed. The 29-year-old Internazionale midfielder had to be resuscitated on the pitch at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen during the first half of his side’s 1-0 Euro 2020 Group B defeat by Finland on Saturday. Eriksen regained consciousness before being taken to hospital, where medics continue to work to identify what caused his cardiac arrest. Providing an update on his status on Thursday, Denmark team doctor Morten Boesen said: “After Christian has been through different heart examinations it has been decided that he should have an ICD (heart starter).” Boesen added: “This device is necessary after cardiac attack due to rhythm disturbances. Christian has accepted the solution and the plan has moreover been confirmed by specialists nationally and internationally who all recommend the same treatment. We encourage everybody to give Christian and his family peace and privacy the following time.” (PA Media) Rafa to Everton? A touch of non-Euros news here: Football Weekly! Or Football Daily! Football something, anyway. Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Nicky Bandini and Lars Sivertsen to discuss the latest action in Groups A and B at Euro 2020. Wrap your ears around this: vsbain67 comments: “How good was all yesterday, but especially Wales? As I said last night, Wales were so good that my German TV had to apologise if it was not appearing neutral, given its gushing enthusiasm for the Welsh performance. A reminder for some of us at least that the best two UK players are Welsh. Such a high impact to have one the biggest global superstars in your team, one of the elite of the elite. That was also visible locally last night. Everyone knows Bale and makes him the focus of attention (and of course his play deserved it).” Indeed, yesterday was something of a classic, as far as group-stage days at tournaments go. I only caught the second half of Russia v Finland, but the two later matches were completely captivating and thrilling. Turkey and Switzerland have both disappointed, in truth ... but who cares? Fans of a certain age possess fond memories of Des Lynam’s presence on our TVs at major tournaments past. Michael Butler spoke to him: “We hired Ruud Gullit, which was a terrific success story,” says Lynam. “The first day he came along, we had this BBC coach, which would take us from ground to ground. Being typical BBC, it was a 30‑year‑old thing covered in rust, and along came Ruud. He got out of his Mercedes limousine, took one step on the bus, and shouted out: ‘What is this shit?’” Kevin de Bruyne grappling with two wheelie suitcases ... Dries Mertens playing cards on a plane. This is the kind of Belgium content we need: Denmark v Belgium, which kicks off at 5pm, is going to be emotional. Following the harrowing events of last Saturday, both the teams and all the fans in the stadium will stage an unusual (but entirely fitting) tribute to the recovering Christian Eriksen, who remains in hospital close to the stadium. The ball will be kicked out of play in the 10th minute, and a minute of applause in support of the Denmark player will begin. Is a Denmark victory too much to hope for ... ? Louise Taylor was watching Wales’s win in Baku last night - “With Ramsey and Bale issuing a timely reminder that form may be temporary but class is permanent, Wales safely negotiated a potentially awkward Euro 2020 crossroads at this far-flung junction of Europe and Asia.” England face Scotland at Wembley tomorrow night - and the central defender Harry Maguire has declared himself fit after ankle ligament damage: Don’t forget, you can get in touch with me on email or Twitter, or post BTL with your thoughts. Wales fans - I want to hear from you! Those of us who backed Italy at 11-1 pre-tournament are feeling like that was a decent bet. There are obvious exceptions down the years, but my feeling on Italy was that they understand how to pull together as a squad at the big tournaments. They generally have a winning mentality as a footballing nation. They seem to be able to leave the egos at the door, commit themselves to the greater good of the team, and thus become greater than the sum of the parts. And the parts, let’s face it, aren’t bad at all. Throw in an experienced coach in Roberto Mancini and they fact they’d kept eight clean sheets on the bounce before the tournament, it seemed like a recipe for a decent showing, at least. Manuel Locatelli cracked in a couple of lovely goals in Italy’s win against Switzerland. Here is Jonathan Liew: “He showed an enormous amount of courage to react in a positive way from the penalty miss, and that speaks a lot about him as a man.” The Wales manager Robert Page poured praise on Gareth Bale after that stirring win against Turkey in Baku last night. Here is Ben Fisher’s story: How good were Wales last night? When Gareth Bale sent that second-half penalty skywards, it looked like a potentially heart-breaking script was being acted out in which Turkey mustered a late equaliser and left Wales in an extremely precarious position in Group A. But Wales were too good: they continued to defend stoutly and found a late goal which literally reduced some of their fans in Baku to tears. Bale’s outstanding delivery for Ramsey’s opening goal, with a finish to match from the Juventus midfielder, will live long in the memory, and Wales’s prospects for the tournament are exciting indeed. Later in the evening, Italy tore into Switzerland playing Roberto Mancini’s own brand of total football, passing and running and pressing with precision and commitment. It was stunning to watch: but when Giorgio Chiellini’s opening goal was ruled out, and he swiftly went off injured, it was a double blow that might have derailed a less capable side. Not a bit of it: the Azzurri kept their foot on Switzerland’s throat and their second successive 3-0 win was a warning to the other tournament contenders. Today, we’ve got Ukraine v North Macedonia, Denmark v Belgium and Netherlands v Austria to look forward to. There will be no shortage of attention on the Denmark match following the shocking events of last weekend and Christian Eriksen’s cardiac arrest during the match against Finland. I’ll bring you all the build-up to today’s matches as well as taking a look to tomorrow and England’s showdown against Scotland at Wembley. Let’s go! Today’s fixtures: Ukraine v North Macedonia (2pm) Denmark v Belgium (5pm) Netherlands v Austria (8pm)"
article92,Death and disruption as Storm Eunice hits mainland Europe,2022-02-18 18:07:44,"['Europe', 'Germany', 'Netherlands', 'World news', 'France']","Storm Eunice has claimed the lives of at least five people on mainland Europe, after it whipped through the UK and Ireland on Friday, bringing chaos to millions. From England, the record-breaking gales have begun moving across the continent, hitting Belgium, the Netherlands and parts of northern France, and are expected to reach Denmark and Germany on Friday evening. Dutch authorities issued a red weather warning and hundreds of flights were cancelled, while trains were halted on Friday afternoon. Four people were reported to have been killed after being hit by falling trees. Pieces of the roof of the ADO The Hague football club stadium were blown off, authorities said. A 79-year-old British man died in the Belgian town of Ypres after being pushed from his boat by the strong winds, according to Reuters. Belgian authorities had appealed to citizens only to venture out in an emergency, while in the northern French province of Brittany, four-metre high waves were reported and rail travel was curtailed. In Denmark, trains were ordered to reduce speed and bridges and roads have been closed in preparation for record winds. In Germany, where the storm has been named Zeynep by meteorologists, it is expected to reach speeds of up to 160km (100 miles) an hour and to last into the early hours of Saturday morning. In addition, a thunderstorm is expected to develop within the storm, meteorologists said. The country, along with neighbouring Poland and the Czech Republic, is still reeling from storm Ylenia, which hit on Wednesday night, uprooting trees, overturning lorries and causing three deaths in Germany, including that of a 37-year-old man whose car was hit by a tree. Deutsche Bahn, the national train operator, cancelled regional and long-distance trains, as emergency services in parts of northern and western Germany, including North Rhine Westphalia, Berlin, Brandenburg and Hamburg, were put on high alert. A spokesperson for DB described the weather warnings as “severe” and urged travellers to delay their journeys, promising that the validity of their tickets would be extended. The German meteorological service (DWD) declared a level three storm warning for the whole country, and highest level four warning for the entire 1,300km (808 mile)-long North Sea coast. On the North Sea islands, winds were expected to reach speeds as high as 170km (105 miles) an hour. The carmaker Volkswagen was one of many factories to close its works in the North Sea coastal town of Emden on Friday afternoon, cancelling both the late and night shifts in anticipation of the storm. DWD called the storms “life threatening” due mainly to flying objects such as falling trees. People were urged to close doors and windows and to secure all movable objects including garden furniture, bikes and portable bins. DWD has predicted widespread flooding in the coming days, particularly in the port cities of Cuxhaven and Hamburg, which was also badly hit by Wednesday’s storm. Authorities said they were braced for water levels to rise three metres above their usual height and put officials on standby to observe all dykes in the region. The weather is expected to remain stormy across large parts of Germany over the following days."
article93,"Size of Nord Stream blasts equal to large amount of explosive, UN told",2022-09-30 16:52:52,"['Nord Stream 1 pipeline', 'Nord Stream 2 pipeline', 'Gas', 'Gas', 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'Europe', 'Business', 'Environment', 'World news']","Denmark and Sweden have said leaks from the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea were caused by blasts equivalent to the power of “several hundred kilograms of explosive”. The conclusions were made in a joint report by Denmark and Sweden which was delivered to the United Nations. The UN environment programme said on Friday the ruptures are likely to have led to the biggest single release of climate-damaging methane ever recorded. German authorities have also said they believe that highly explosive detonations were responsible for the sabotage attacks on the two pipelines. The EU, Nato and the governments of Poland, Sweden and Denmark have all said they believe the leaks were caused deliberately. Data analysis has revealed huge clouds of methane gas are hovering over the leaks, from natural gas that has been pouring into the Baltic Sea from both pipelines since Monday, the ICOS, a greenhouse gas observation system operating across Europe, reported. The pipes, built to transport gas from Russia to Germany, and only one of which was ever activated but both of which were full of gas, are said to be unusable due to the damage caused by the ruptures. Intelligence sources quoted in the news magazine Spiegel believe the pipelines were hit in four places by explosions using 500kg of TNT, the equivalent to the explosive power of a heavy aircraft bomb. German investigators have undertaken seismic readings to calculate the power of the blasts. The first signs of explosions were registered on Monday morning by a Danish earthquake station after suspicious activity in the waters of the Baltic Sea. A monitoring station on the Danish island of Bornholm measured severe tremors. A representative of the Swedish coastguard told AFP: “There are two leaks on Swedish territory and two on the Danish side.” It remains a mystery as to how the explosives reached the pipeline. According to initial reports, the explosions happened at depths of between 70 and 90 metres. There has been speculation that mini submarines might have been used to deliver the explosives. However, the amount of explosives that would have been necessary to cause such large blasts make this theory increasingly unlikely. Instead, experts are suggesting that maintenance robots operating within the pipeline structure may have planted the bombs during repair works. If this theory proves to be right, the sophisticated nature of the attack as well as the power of the blast would add weight to suspicions that the attacks were carried out by a state power, with fingers pointed at Russia. Moscow has repeatedly underlined its capability to disrupt Europe’s energy infrastructure. On Friday, Vladimir Putin blamed the US and its allies for blowing up the pipelines, raising the temperature in the crisis. Offering no evidence for his claim, the Russian president said in a speech to mark the annexation of four Ukrainian regions: “The sanctions were not enough for the Anglo-Saxons: they moved on to sabotage. It is hard to believe but it is a fact that they organised the blasts on the Nord Stream international gas pipelines.” The methane clouds are being monitored closely. The ICOS, which is analysing the air quality, has shown footage of a huge gas cloud hovering above the Baltic Sea and moving across Europe. Methane measuring stations in Sweden, Norway and Finland had indicated sharp rises in methane in recent days. Observation satellites are believed to have failed to record the emissions due to cloudy weather, the ICOS said. It said the emissions were equivalent to an entire year’s methane output for a city “the size of Paris or a country like Denmark”. “This is really bad, most likely the largest emission event ever detected,” Manfredi Caltagirone, acting head of UNEP’s International Methane Emissions Observator told Reuters. “This is not helpful in a moment when we absolutely need to reduce emissions.” Prof Stephen Platt, from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, said: “We assume the wind on the leak area blew the methane emissions north until the Finnish archipelago, then bent towards Sweden and Norway.” Germany’s federal environment agency has estimated that emissions equivalent to 7.5m tons of CO2 have been released into the atmosphere. That equates to about 1% of Germany’s entire annual emissions. Gregor Rehder, of the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research in the northern town of Warnemünde, told Spiegel: “That is quite a considerable amount of greenhouse gas that has been released.” Methane is one of the strongest greenhouse gases, warming the atmosphere about 30 times more than carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years. The timing and scale of the leak should be viewed with even more alarm owing to the immediate necessity to slow down climate change, the ICOS said. German investigators told media that divers or remote-controlled robots may be able to visit the site of the leaks as early as this weekend."
article94,‘More than a game’: Euros delirium in Denmark despite UK travel setback,2021-07-06 10:39:22,"['Denmark', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Denmark', 'Euro 2020', 'Sport', 'Football', 'European Championship', 'England', 'UK news']","People dancing on buses is not something you see every day in Denmark. Rule-abiding Danes tend to keep their celebrations low-key – but not this summer. Football fans brought traffic to a standstill in Aarhus after Denmark beat the Czech Republic in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals and even scaled public transport to broadcast their euphoria and belt out another round of Re-sepp-ten – first a hit for Denmark’s national team at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. The anthem’s crowd-sourced lyrics are laden with Hans Christian Andersen imagery and feel particularly apt this year. “It’s been such an emotional time for everyone, but especially for Danish football,” says Karina Hansford, 45, referring to the collapse of the midfielder Christian Eriksen after a cardiac arrest during Denmark’s game against Finland on 12 June. “We have all experienced losses over the pandemic, so what happened with Eriksen brought up a lot of strong feelings,” says Morten Pelch, 40, adding: “In that moment, the whole of Denmark was holding their breath.” “It was a reminder that life can be short,” says Hansford. “My first reaction was thinking about his kids and what would happen to them. But Eriksen’s teammates managed it so well, it was pure instinct: they formed a protective shield around him so the cameras couldn’t get to him.” Eriksen was taken to hospital while the world waited. Once news arrived that he was stable, a decision was made to restart the game. “Although by then, the match didn’t matter,” says Pelch. “The result came second.” Denmark lost but Eriksen’s collapse was all anyone in the country could talk about for days. “No matter who you met, they were still in shock,” says Pelch. “What happened showed perfectly how football is more than just a game,” says Anne Nielsen, 34. “It’s also about humanity and what we value in life – like togetherness; team spirit and fighting for the ones you love. I think almost everyone in Denmark felt this.” Pelch compares the heightened sense of emotion and camaraderie to a wartime spirit: “People began coming together in a way almost like when Denmark was liberated from occupation after world war two.” But Denmark’s Euro 2020 campaign has offered life lessons for the future too, say Danes. The head coach and former player Kasper Hjulmand apologised for the decision to continue playing after Eriksen’s collapse. “He said ‘I’m wrong and I’m sorry’, which is pretty brave,’ says Pelch. “He accepts failure, – that sometimes when we get things wrong then we should admit it and apologise – in doing so he’s become an icon for our leaders.” Hjulmand has also been praised for encouraging a new model of masculinity in Denmark. “He talks a lot about emotions and feelings, telling the team it’s OK to embrace these,” says Pelch. “He’s showing men that in 2021, it’s not about being tough or hard, it’s about being present and kind. He teaches that there’s strength in unity; that you have to be there for your teammates; and when someone is down, you help them up.’ Once Danes knew that Eriksen was OK, there was a sense that the only way was up for the players. “Now, it feels as though all of Denmark has been waiting for a big party,” says Hansford. “‘Euphoric’ is probably the word for how many Danes feel right now,” adds Nielsen. “People really want to be together in person after the long Covid winter.” The demand for big screens showing matches in public has shot up, the atmosphere is electric and the only regret that many have is that they cannot watch the game in person. British authorities have refused to allow Danish fans to travel to the UK for the semi-final because of coronavirus restrictions. Fans are disappointed but sanguine. “When the Vikings left Denmark to conquer the world, there weren’t so many of them either,” says Pelch. “But they were still victorious.” • This article was amended on 7 July 2021 to correct an instance where the spelling of Eriksen was given as “Erikson”."
article95,Denmark determined to deliver where it all began for Christian Eriksen,2021-06-25 17:56:54,"['Euro 2020', 'Denmark', 'Wales', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","Denmark will not have the raw emotion of Parken behind them for the first time at Euro 2020 when they face Wales but Amsterdam holds its own power and poignancy for Kasper Hjulmand’s team. The city, and stadium, where Christian Eriksen started his professional career offers a fitting stage for the Danes to deliver another tribute to their stricken playmaker. “We are playing in Christian’s old home,” said the Denmark head coach. “We are really looking forward to this after a great experience at the Parken [Stadium] and some crazy days. We had three games at Parken that were filled with enough emotion to last an entire lifetime and now we are so excited to give it our all against Wales.” Eriksen was 16 when he signed his first professional contract with Ajax in 2008, following a path trodden by many celebrated Danish footballers, and Hjulmand believes the country’s close connections with the famous Amsterdam club will bring added support for his players on Saturday. That appears guaranteed, with the Dutch authorities giving Denmark fans a 12-hour window to attend the last-16 tie while banning Welsh supporters because the UK is not on their designated safe list. “If there is a club that means something to Danish football outside of Denmark and has done something for Denmark then it is Ajax,” Hjulmand said. “They have been developing and improving Danish players for years so of course there is a huge connection between Amsterdam, Ajax and Denmark. We have three players from there in this squad. “Christian was 16 when he came to Ajax and left five years later. Then there’s [Kasper] Dolberg and many others I could mention were discovered in Denmark and developed in Ajax. “I know a lot of people here and the philosophy they have behind football is something I respect a lot. Johan Cruyff was one of the biggest players and coaches in football. I feel connected to this and the philosophy they have. We have a huge connection to this city and I hope everyone in the Netherlands will feel the same thing tomorrow and come in red and white and not orange. I hope we will have some support from this wonderful place.” Denmark’s head coach believes there is a power driving his team in their response to the cardiac arrest suffered by Eriksen in the opening game against Finland. He said: “We dealt with a very traumatic experience and the same night we kept playing. Then we played one of the best teams in the world a couple of days later [Belgium] and then we beat Russia. That shows the power we possess. It is both a mental and physical power.” Hjulmand added: “We respect Wales. What they’ve done in the last few years is really good, they remind us of ourselves. They are proud to represent their country, everyone supports them and the players always give their best football. We respect them a lot. At the same time we feel safe and comfortable in the things we do. We have so much power that we will hopefully have again tomorrow in what I consider to be an equal game.” There will be several club reunions on the pitch with the two goalkeepers, Kasper Schmeichel and Danny Ward, teammates at Leicester and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg up against his Tottenham colleague of last season Gareth Bale. “Not many players have done what Gareth has done over the past 10 years,” said the Denmark midfielder, who has three assists in three games at the Euros. “He is an amazing player, a fantastic guy, a leader. He’s one of the best players I’ve ever played with. I know how much Wales means to him and what this game means to him. I wish him all the best but not tomorrow.”"
article96,"Snow, sunburn and second lunches: Danish paddleboarder’s 870-mile odyssey",2022-04-11 04:45:00,"['Denmark', 'Europe', 'World news']","A 28-year-old Dane is battling storms, snow, and waves several metres high in an attempt to become the first person to make his way around his home country on a stand-up paddleboard (Sup). Casper “The Viking” Steinfath, a six-time Sup world champion, set off from his home beach in Klitmøller – known as Cold Hawaii – on 2 April with nothing more than a tent, a sleeping bag, a cooking set and some meal packages. He plans to camp inland each night and rely on the kindness of strangers to help him get through the 870-mile (1,400km) journey around Denmark’s jagged coastline in some of the worst weather Danes have encountered all year. “Growing up by the North Sea in Jutland, I’m used to playing in any type of conditions,” Steinfath said. “But yesterday was pretty horrendous … I’m currently sunburned, windburned and I have frozen fingers. It’s a weird combination.” He said his strategy for coping was “chapstick, SPF 40 and dancing to Rage Against the Machine every 45 minutes to stop my feet going numb.” Steinfath was inspired to take on the challenge while grounded during the pandemic. “Before corona, I spent 10 years travelling the world for watersports competitions and was away for at least nine months of every year, so the pandemic is the longest period I’ve spent at home since I was a child.” After a brief “rest”, he said, he became curious about Denmark and the Danes. “I dreamed of rediscovering my back yard and the hidden gems of it I haven’t seen yet.” He was most looking forward to seeing South Funen, or the Danish Caribbean as it is optimistically known, and Møns Klint, the 70m-year-old chalk cliffs crumbling into the Baltic Sea two hours south of Copenhagen. Would-be Vikings can follow the progress of what’s being called The Great Danish Paddle via a live GPS map or via @cj_steinfath on Instagram, and then join Steinfath to sail, row or paddle along with him. “I loved watching Forrest Gump as a kid and the scene with the running really stuck with me,” Steinfath said, recalling the 1994 film in which the title character is joined on a cross-country run by others who see him as a guru. Steinfath’s hopes are more humble. “I don’t mind if one person, 10 people or 100 people join me, I’ll just be stoked with any company. Danes come out of their winter caves in spring and there’s a real energy in the air, so it’s a great time to see Denmark.” He aims to paddle about 25 miles a day, carrying 30kg of equipment on his board. On a calm day this means paddling for six or seven hours and taking on in the region of 6,000 calories. “I’m about to eat my second lunch,” he said. While Steinfath was looking forward to the rest of the trip, he was also nervous. “Denmark seems tiny on a map, but there’s a long way to go to get around it on a Sup.” The Great Danish Paddle is expected take between 40 and 50 days. “But who knows, with the Danish weather,” Steinfath said. “There is one immovable deadline on the horizon: ‘I’m getting married in August so I have to be on dry land by then.”"
article97,‘A great thing’: Southgate hails England’s Wembley return for Denmark semi-final,2021-07-04 21:30:32,"['Euro 2020', 'Gareth Southgate', 'England', 'Denmark', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","Gareth Southgate has said that returning to Wembley to feed off a pulsating atmosphere will help England in their Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark on Wednesday. England, who are back on home soil after travelling to Rome to beat Ukraine on Saturday, benefited from the backing of their supporters in their last-16 win against Germany last Tuesday and Southgate hopes that playing in front of a 60,000 crowd at Wembley against Denmark will give his side added motivation as they attempt to reach England’s first European Championship final. “It’s great to be coming back now,” Southgate said. “To go and have that different environment, preparation, focus was definitely helpful. But now to be coming back to Wembley is a great thing for us. It’s not for me to tell the fans how to be or what to be. “They found a pretty good way of doing that in the last game. So just be as they have been really and in the end the responsibility is on us to play well and affect the emotions in the stadium. But without a doubt the two things fed off each other in the last game. That can only be helpful for the team.” England lost against Croatia in the last four of the World Cup three years ago but Southgate is confident his players will not struggle with the psychological challenge of playing in a semi-final. “We’ve knocked off so many hoodoos or perceived barriers already and I feel like this group of players will feel this is just the next challenge,” the manager said. “I guess the interesting part for us is we won’t feel totally satisfied if it’s just a semi-final for us whereas maybe three years ago, although there was massive disappointment, there was a feeling we’d come a long way. “Now we’ve replicated what we did there, but that won’t be enough to fulfil the group. That’s a positive sign. The other thing that is so positive, these young players, they’re getting more experiences that are positive and enjoyable.” Southgate said Bukayo Saka would be fit to face Denmark after missing the win against Ukraine with a minor knock."
article98,Monkeypox isn’t the disease we should be worried about | John Vidal,2022-05-25 05:00:26,"['Monkeypox', 'Infectious diseases', 'Microbiology', 'Science', 'World news', 'Farming', 'Animals', 'Environment', 'Biology']","In the past three weeks there have been nearly 100 cases and 18 human deaths from a rare tick-borne disease in Iraq; a fourth case of the Ebola virus and more than 100 cases of bubonic plague have been found in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and just two years after Africa was declared free of wild polio, new cases have turned up in Malawi and Mozambique. A dangerous strain of typhus is circulating in Nepal, India and China. There are alarming outbreaks on several continents of mosquito diseases such as malaria, dengue and West Nile virus. Set against this global context, the so-far very limited monkeypox outbreaks that have started to appear in the last month – including 71 cases detected in the UK – are only remarkable because they are being reported in rich countries. It has been a bad month for infectious disease, according to the ProMED website, the world’s largest open surveillance system for reporting outbreaks. Covid and HIV are both still globally rampant, and now animal pandemics are on the march, too. African swine fever continues to ravage the world’s pigs and several strains of lethal avian – or bird flu – are spreading, forcing the cull of hundreds of millions of poultry. Vets and ecologists have warned this month, too, of mysterious fungal diseases being found in fish and marine life in Australia and in Middle Eastern countries, well as lethal dog and other pet illnesses. We live uneasily with many thousands of potentially fatal viruses circulating in other species, but what is remarkable is that most of those that affect humans today were unknown just 70 years ago. Not only are new pathogens jumping from animals to humans more often, but an increasing number are linked to the changes in the global and local environments. It is no coincidence that since 1940, 335 new and potentially fatal diseases have emerged globally, over a period when the human population has trebled, the climate has changed and more meat is being eaten. Disease ecologists say that nothing increases the risk of a crossover of a pathogen from one species to another like the uncontrolled expansion of farming, and the exploitation by humans of wild species. It is now payback time for nature. The more human numbers have grown and we have encroached on wild spaces or imposed unnatural conditions on other species, the more we have created the ideal environments for viruses and pathogens to spill across species, mutate and spread. HIV, Ebola, Lassa fever and monkey pox in Africa; Sars and Covid-19 in China; Chagas, Machupo and Hantavirus in Latin America; Hendra in Australia; Mers in Saudi Arabia – all have all emerged in the past 75 years just as we have accelerated deforestation, moved to cities, come closer to animals and created a global economy. Most worrying for humans is not monkeypox, plague or even Ebola, which sound dangerous and exotic but are actually more or less controllable now with vaccines. Instead, the threat of a new bird flu, just as likely to come out of a farm in New York or England as one in China or Bolivia, now stalks humanity. Chicken is now the rich world’s most popular meat and tens of millions of near-genetically identical birds prone to catastrophic disease are being mass-reared at any one time, often in unhygienic conditions, and are able to mix with wild birds. It is only a matter of decades before a new highly pathogenic avian influenza strain evolves to be easily transmissible between humans. As much by luck as good judgment, humans dodged a bullet with Sars in 2003 and to some extent with Covid, which so far has killed about 1% of people infected. But major flu pandemics with very high mortality rates come along every 30 years or so and we are well overdue the next. If we are lucky we will find a vaccine fast and it will only kill 10-20% of people it infects. If we are unlucky, it could be just as transmissible as Omicron and as fatal as Ebola – in which case it would effectively be game over for much of humanity and the global economy. But we may have seen nothing yet. Climate change is now kicking in, creating a hotter, sicker world with a potentially catastrophic impact on disease. Global heating fundamentally changes the landscape of disease by forcing or enabling species to survive in new places and mix with others. Insects already kill about 700,000 people a year, but global heating allows mosquitoes, mites, fleas, ticks and other vectors to flourish in new areas, spreading dengue, chikungunya, and other diseases to higher ground or to previously cooler climates. Canadian bacteriologists have shown how in times of great historical environmental change – like now – pathogens jump more easily to new, susceptible hosts. All they need is the opportunity for contact, and warming does just that. Once they have expanded to new hosts, novel variants are more likely to emerge, each with new infection capacities. The situation looks bleak, but it is well within human ability to repair and turn this round. Science and new technologies are catching up with vaccines for rare and neglected diseases, and global surveillance and the early detection of potential virus spillovers in the wild can be greatly enhanced. But above all, global finance can be directed to improve creaking public health systems, especially in developing countries. They are the first line of defence and the surest precaution of disease containment. The big lesson of Covid – and now of monkeypox – is that much infectious disease has its roots in ecological change. That means the health of the planet and the health of humans and must be considered alongside that of animals. It also means we should prepare now for the unexpected, invest in public health as never before, stop cutting down the forests, address climate change and phase out intensive farming. A “one health”, planetary approach to health is the best – and possibly the only – hope we have. • John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor"
article99,Czech Republic 1-2 Denmark: Euro 2020 quarter-final – as it happened,2021-07-03 18:08:00,"['Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Czech Republic', 'Denmark', 'Football', 'Sport']","Here’s how Paul Doyle saw the action unfold as Denmark saw off the Czechs in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku ... Meanwhile in Rome: There’s another quarter-final taking place tonight which ytou may or may not have heard about. Kick-off is in an hour but Scott Murray has the latest ... Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep! Barak fires one last shot wide for the Czechs, Kasper Schmeichel takes the goal-kick and referee BJorn Kuipers blows three sharp blasts on his whistle. The Danes are through, courtesy of first-half goals from Thomas Delaney and Kasper Dolberg. Patrik Schick’s strike early in the second half proved little more than a consolation for the Czechs. Denmark will face England or Ukraine in the semi-final. It’s all over: Denmark go through to the semi-finals after a strange game in Baku. 90+5 min: Jankto plays the ball wide to Couffal on the right touchline. His cross is cleared. Another ball into the Danish penalty area is headed clear by Simon Kjaer. 90+4 min: Denmark throw-in, halfway inside the Czech half. The ball’s played to Wass, on for Stryger-Larsen, but his curled cross to the far post is headed clear. 90+2 min: Couffal drills a low ball into the Danish penalty area from the centre but it’s hoofed clear by Andersen. 90+1 min: In Soucek and Boril, the Czechs have two players sporting bloody white bandages on their heads. Will they be enough?!?!?!? 90 min: We’re going to have six added minutes. 88 min: Denmark break upfield with Braithwaite on the ball. He passes wide to Hjoebjerg and keeps running into the penalty are for the return pass, which duly arrives. Braithwaite appears to throw himself to the ground looking for a penalty but doesn’t get one. 86 min: Thomas Kalas is booked for a rather agricultural challenge on Christian Norgaard. 85 min: Simon Kjaer holds Vydra back by his arm as the substitute attempts to run on to a ball from deep. Vydra appeals for a free-kick, doesn’t get one and his team-mate Michael Krmenick is booked for complaining to the referee. 82 min: Martin Braithwaite is furious and who can blame him? Played in behind down the inside left by Poulsen, Joakim Maele selfishly shoots from a tight angle and see his effort saved by Vaclik. If he’d squared the ball, Braithwaite had an open goal to slot into. 81 min: Denmark double-substitution: Joachim Andersen and Mathias Jensen on for Andreas Christensen and Thomas Delaney. 80 min: Czech substitution: Patrik Schick walks off feeling his left hamstring and is replaced by Burnley’s Matej Vydra. 78 min: Poulsen escapes Brabec and has a snap-shot from the edge of the penalty area saved by Vaclik after connecting with a cross from the right. 74 min: Free-kick for the Czechs, wide on the right. Brabec curls the ball across the face of goal and Schmeichel dithers but just gets enough of a hand on the ball to take it off the bandaged head of Soucek, who was lurking. Nothing comes of the ensuing corner. 72 min: Jankto pounces on a poor clearance from Kjaer, takes a touch and unleashes a shot across the face of goal. Kjaer blocks his effort, which was not on target. 70 min: Yussuf Poulsen breaks through the centre and unleashes a shot from distance. His low drive is saved easily by Tomas Vaclik in the Czech goal. 68 min: This half seems weirdly disjointed and lacking in urgency, more like an end-of-season Premier League game between two mid-table sides than a European Championship eliminator. Perhaps it’s the heat, player fatigue, the lack of a decent sized crowd, the absence of many supporters from either country or a combination of all those factors. 66 min: While Soucek was being patched up, his teammate Ondrej Celuska was helped off by two team-mates, having apparently pulled his hamstring or a calf muscle. He’s replaced by Jakub Brabec. 63 min: Tomas Soucek slides in to block a Poulsen shot in the Czech penalty area and gets an accidental kick in the head for his troubles. He’s bandaged up Terry Butcher style and and is passed fit to continue. 61 min: Poulsen sprints down the left flank leaving Couffal in his dust and squares the ball across the edge of the Czech penalty area for Braithwaite. His pass inside is cleared. 60 min: Denmark double-substitution: Christian Norgaard and Yussuf Poulsen on for Mikkel Damsgaard and Kasper Dolberg. 58 min: Janko swings a cross into the Danish penalty area from the left. It’s too close to Kasper Schmeichel, who gathers comfortably. 56 min: Andreas Christensen curls a cross towards the far post from just outside the Czech penalty area. Coufal dives to head it out for a corner. Schick clears the inswinger. 54 min: The Czech Republic are completely in the ascendency in this second half, with their burly substitute Krmencik wreaking havoc up front. Denmark’s defenders simply don’t knopw what to do with him and his distracting presence is making loads of space for Schick. 52 min: Czech Republic half-time substitutes: Krmencik and Jakub Janko on for Lukas Masopust and Tomas Holes. 50 min: It’s been an astonishing start to the second half from the Czech Republic, who forced Schmeichel into three saves in the opening four minutes before beating him courtesy of a Schick finish through the legs of Jannik Vestergaard. The Czechs are bouncing! Patrik Schick steers a cross from Vladimir Coufal into the bottom left-hand corner, despite having a defender directly in front of him. 46 min: Play resumes and Kasper Schmeichel is immediately called into action twice in quick succession. He saves a long-range effort from Michael Krmenchik, who has just come on as a sub. Then moments later he saves a half-volley from Antonin Barak. A confession: I didn’t notice at the time but it turns out that the corner from which Denmark opened the scoring should not have been awarded. It should have been a goal kick for the Czechs. Nevertheless, once it was awarded the Czechs had a duty to defend it properly and were found sadly wanting. Peep! A ridiculously open first 45 minutes ends with Denmark leading courtesy of goals scored at the beginning and end of the half. Thomas Delaney opened the scoring, heading home from an early corner. Kasper Dolberg doubled Denmark’s lead just before the break, sidefooting home a remarkable outside-of-the-boot cross from Joakim Maehle. The Czech Republic have had their chances but have posed few problems. 45 min: That cross from Joakim Maehle should be in a museum or art gallery. It was quite outstanding - just an insoucient swish with the outside of his right boot as he chased the ball down the flank with Coufal in hot pursuit. The Czech defender was probably waiting for him to stop and cut inside, but Maehle was having none of it. Braithewaite missed the header from six yards, but Dolberg was waiting behind him at the far post to volley home. 43 min: The ball’s played down the left flank for right-footed left wing-back Joakim Maehle to chase. Without pausing or breaking stride, he flicks an unbelievable cross into the penalty area with ther outside of his right foot, teeing up Dolberg at the far post. The striker makes no mistake, volleying home from seven or eight yards out. A wonderful, wonderful goal. Oh my, what a goal! Denmark double their lead. 40 min: There’s a break in play as a couple of players get treated for knocks. Their teammates adjourn to the sideline for an impromptu drinks party. 39 min: Celebrating his 21st birthday today, Damsgaard finds himself galloping down the inside-right and unleashes a low diagonal shot in the direction of the Czech goal. Vaclik saves comfortably. 35 min: Czech chance! Tomas Holes shoots straight at Schmeichel from the edge of the penalty area as the ball breaks his way. 34 min: From deep, Damsgaard plays a ball through the centre along the floor to Dolberg outside the penalty area, who in turn plays it further forward for the chasing Stryger-Larsen. Czech goalkeeper Vaclik dashes off his line and just beats the Danish right wing-back to the ball. 33 min: It’s a weird old game, with barely any fans of either team in the 70,000-seater stadium. In total there’s fewer than 15,000 punters in. 30 min: The Czech Republic win a free-kick which is taken from deep and lofted towards the far post. Ondrej Celuska leaps to try and nod the ball goalwards but fails to make contact with it. Rather than the ball being too high for him it looked like he mistimed his jump ... although he might have got a little shove from Jannik Vestergaard. 30 min: Thomas Delaney drives forward to the edge of the Czech penalty area, only to run into traffic and be relieved of possession. 28 min: Martin Braithwaite canters forward down the right flank for Denmark ,cuts inside and shoots wide from a tight angle. It seems inconceivable that there won’t be more goals in this match at the moment. 25 min: Czech corner. Sevcik sends the ball deep and Tomas Soucek skims it wide of the far post off his head. He got a clean header there and perhaps should have done better. 22 min: Schmeichel sends a poor clearance straight to the feet of Czech midfielder Lukas Masopust, who controls the ball, advances and cuts inside. He plays the ball into the path of Holes, who brings a smart save out of Schmeichel from a tight angle. Atonement. 19 min: Czech corner. Antonin Barak’s inswinger goes wide off the shoulder of Tomas Kalas. 18 min: Denmark clear after good work by Schick in the penalty area, picking up a pass from Vladimir Coufal. This match is remarkably open. 17 min: From eight yards out, Delaney “knees” one wide with his right leg. The goal was at his mercy after a wonderful cross from Braithwaite. 15 min: Another chance goes to waste for the Czech Republic. A half-clearance drops for Sevcik, who blasts a volley high over the cross-bar. If he’d kept it down, one suspects it would have been unstoppable. 13 min: From the corner, Hjoebjerg boots the ball long out of defence, sending Mikkel Damsgaard on his way. He gets through on goal but is unable to control the ball properly and fails to unleash a shot. A let-off for the Czech Republic. 11 min: Patrik Schick runs to the byline, cuts back inside and curls a deflected shot high and wide of the Danish goal. Corner for the Czechs. 9 min: Another Danish corner after a Kasper dolberg shot is put out. This one is sent to the back post, aimed at Jannik Vestergaard. He is unable to emulate his teammate’s effort from earlier. 7 min: Those Danes who are in the Olympic Stadium in Baku are beside themselves with delight. The marking on the part of the Czech Republic was hideously bad. A Danish blocker saw to it that Delaney was left unmarked and given a free header – the midfielder made no mistake. He didn’t need to make a run and barely even had to jump. From the corner, Stryger-Larsen’s delivery to the edge of the six-yard box is perfect. Thomas Delaney gets a free header and sends his downward effort into the bottom corner. 5 min: Denmark corner. And it’s a goal! 3 min: Vladimir Coufal is teed up for a shot from the outside of the Danish penalty area and time seems to stand still. He swings his boot at the ball but his effort is blocked. 1 min: Denmark get the ball rolling, in a stadium that’s over 2,000 miles from both Copenhagen and Prague. On ITV, commentator Clive Tyldesely speculates that there might be 1,500 Danish fans present and fewer than 300 Czechs. Well done, Uefa. Well done. Weather report: It’s 28 degrees celsius in Baku, with humidity at 61%. Before a ball has been kicked, quite a few of the players have already got their sweat on. Not long now: The Czech Republic make their way out on to the pitch in Baku, the players led by Tomas Soucek and wearing red shirts, navy shorts and navy socks. Their opponents follow soon after wearing white shirts, socks and shorts with red trim. It’s time for the national anthems and kick-off is less than five minutes away. Less than 15 minutes to go: ITV finally turn their attention to the game they’re covering. I recall on one glorious occasion the great RTE pundit John Giles repeatedly referring to one of the teams involved in today’s game as “the Czech Republicans” during a match they played against Ireland. Despite being wrong, we all knew what he meant and he was probably extremely right. ITV: There’s been ne’er a mention of either the Czech Republic or Denmark on ITV’s coverage so far but I am assured they are covering the game. It’s been wall-to-wall England so far. Those teams: Jan Boril is back from his spell on the Naughty Step and the left-back comes back into the Czech side in place of Pavel Kaderabek, who drops to the bench. Czech captain Vladimir Darida is on the bench, so Tomas Soucek takes the armband. The Danish side is unchanged from that started against Wales. Yussuf Poulsen starts on the bench as Kasper Dolberg keeps his place. Daniel Wass is also among the substitutes, with Jens Stryger-Larsen having done enough to keep his place at right wing-back. Czech Republic: Vaclik, Coufal, Celustka, Kalas, Boril, Holes, Soucek, Masopust, Barak, Sevcik, Schick. Subs: Kaderabek, Brabec, Darida, Krmencik, Jankto, Mandous, Zima, Vydra, Kral, Koubek, Pekhart, Pesek. Denmark: Schmeichel, Christensen, Kjaer, Vestergaard, Stryger Larsen, Hojbjerg, Delaney, Maehle, Braithwaite, Dolberg, Damsgaard. Subs: Andersen, Skov, Skov Olsen, Mathias Zanka Jorgensen, Norgaard, Lossl, Wass, Wind, Poulsen, Cornelius, Ronnow, Jensen. Referee: Bjorn Kuipers (Holland) Tonight’s match officials Referee: Björn Kuipers (Netherlands) Assistant referees: Sander van Roekel and Erwin Zeinstra (Netherlands) Fourth official: Sergei Karasev (Russia) Video Assistant Referee: Pol van Boekel (Netherlands) Kasper Hjulmand speaks ... “I can’t look anywhere without getting motivated,” said Denmark’s manager. “We’re doing it for the whole of Denmark and we have two dreams: to win something and to inspire and excite. “We have a framework and philosophy that we stick to but, inside that, there is also space for tactical things, positions, and the skill of the individual players. There is always room for variations and tactical thoughts. Of course, we always try to find the right framework for the players to work in and, of course, it’s the same way with the Czechs.” Jaroslav Silhavy speaks ... “Denmark are really strong as a team,” said the Czech Republic manager of tonight’s opponents. “Their style is similar to ours. We know they may miss some players like Poulsen, Kjaer and others, but they have very good replacements and their quality will be the same. Nothing easy is ahead of us. “We have to match them in commitment and approach. I believe we are capable to do so. Then the quality will play its role. One mistake may decide the course of the match and make it favourable for one side.” “As regards our starting line-up, Vladimír Darida has regained fitness but we will wait to see how he will feel after today’s training session. But nothing has been 100% decided yet on who will start.” Early team news For the Czech Republic, Slavia Prague left-back Jan Boril is available after suspension and may return to the side. Brought in to face the Netherlands, midfielders Antonin Barak and Petr Sevcik may keep their places in Jaroslav Silhavy’s starting XI. Despite doubts over his fitness, Czech captain Vladimir Darida has told reporters he has trained well and is available if required. Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand has some big decisions to make, with striker Yussuf Poulson and right-back Daniel Wass reported to be fit again after missing the win over Wales. Kasper Dolberg proved a more than able deputy for Poulsen and could keep his place after scoring two goals. Despite limping off during the second half against Wales, skipper Simon Kjaer is also reported to be available for selection. Christian Eriksen, of course, remains absent but one suspects he will very much present in spirit. Football Weekly goes daily ...

article100,Coronavirus live news: Denmark to give third jab to care home residents – as it happened,2021-09-03 23:05:14,"['Coronavirus', 'World news', 'North Korea', 'Australia news', 'New Zealand']","We are closing the blog now. Thanks for following. You can see all our coronavirus coverage here. The UK government’s vaccines watchdog has decided there is not enough evidence to recommend the rollout of Covid vaccines to all 12- to 15-year-olds, but has held open the possibility of ministers seeking other advice to go ahead nonetheless. Moderna Inc said it has submitted for conditional approval of a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine at a 50 microgram dose level to the EU drugs regulator, Reuters reports. Brazil recorded 25,565 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours along with 756 deaths, the country’s health ministry said on Friday. Brazil has registered more than 20 million cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 582,670, according to ministry data, Reuters reports In Denmark, the country’s health minister Magnus Heunicke has announced residents in nursing homes will get a third shot of the Covid vaccine, starting next week. The US government’s plan to roll out additional shots of the coronavirus vaccine for the general public on September 20 will proceed with just the Pfizer vaccine, a source familiar with the discussion said on Friday. Italy’s prime minister has announced his government could make Covid vaccines mandatory, sparking a row in the country that has seen a recent rise in protests and violence from anti-vaxxers. Spain’s two-week Covid rate fell below 200 cases per 100,000 people for the first time in over two months, according to its health ministry. In the US, Joe Biden has said he will set out his administration’s next steps to combat the coronavirus Delta variant next week. North Korea leader Kim Jong-un has ordered officials to wage a tougher epidemic prevention campaign in “our style” after he turned down some foreign vaccines offered via the UN-backed immunisation programme. Mexico’s health ministry reported 17,409 new cases of Covid-19 and 725 more deaths on Friday, Reuters reports. It brings the total number of confirmed cases in the country since the pandemic began to 3,405,294 and the death toll to 262,221. You can follow the latest Covid developments in Australia in our dedicated blog - The front page of Saturday’s Guardian. American Airlines said it would not provide special leave from next month to unvaccinated employees who have to quarantine due to coronavirus. Unvaccinated workers will have to use their sick time or medical leave if they miss work due to the disease, it said. “Given there is an FDA-approved vaccine, pandemic leave will only be offered to team members who are fully vaccinated and who provide their vaccination card to us,” the carrier said in a memo to staff seen by Reuters. The move comes after United Airlines Inc last month became the first U.S. carrier to require vaccinations for all domestic employees. Brazil recorded 25,565 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours along with 756 deaths, the country’s health ministry said on Friday. Brazil has registered more than 20 million cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 582,670, according to ministry data, Reuters reports. Five officers were injured and 10 people arrested during clashes with anti-vaccine protesters in London, the Metropolitan Police said. The force said a number of protesters had “become violent” towards police during action in the capital. In a tweet, Scotland Yard said “These ugly scenes are not why police officers come into work. This level of violence is totally unacceptable and it will not be tolerated. “Five officers were injured while policing a protest group in Canary Wharf and at South Kensington. “Crowds quickly became hostile when they reached a building in Canary Wharf. Officers moved in to prevent those protesting from gaining entry.” It took nine days for the New South Wales health department to contact Antoinette Chidiac after she visited Trim’s Fresh in Merrylands, western Sydney, where there was a positive Covid case in mid-July. Across New South Wales, people have been experiencing long delays between visiting a high-risk Covid exposure site and being notified to isolate and test as a close contact, prompting warnings from one epidemiologist that the contact tracing system is “overwhelmed”, which would be “a recipe for disaster”. For Liz Giusti in Liverpool, who visited a Sydney Woolworths in mid-July, and Jodie Wright, who also visited a Woolworths last month, there was no notification at all. “I checked in to the supermarket QR code,” Giusti told Guardian Australia. “I later realised, after scrolling through my check-in history on the Service NSW app, that my visit was within the same hour as the positive case. But I still wasn’t alerted. The US administered 373,516,809 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country as of Friday morning and distributed 447,619,715 doses, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC0 said. Those figures are up from the 372,116,617 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Sept. 2 out of 445,672,595 doses delivered, Reuters reports. The agency said 206,461,869 people had received at least one dose while 175,538,025 people were fully vaccinated as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Friday. Moderna Inc said on Friday it has submitted for conditional approval of a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine at a 50 microgram dose level to the EU drugs regulator, Reuters reports. A White House plan to offer Covid-19 booster shots will most likely start this month only with the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, a source told Reuters. President Joe Biden had expected to launch a campaign to administer 100 million booster shots on September 20. But U.S. vaccine makers other than Pfizer have lagged in seeking authorization of an additional dose. Moderna Inc only started submitting data for regulatory approval of a booster shot on Wednesday and said on Friday it had completed its submission. “We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA and advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)“, White House spokesman Chris Meagher said. “When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation*s top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus.” Four officers have been injured during clashes with anti-vaccine protesters in London, the Metropolitan Police said. The force said a number of protesters had “become violent” towards police during action in the capital. The Met said it had made 10 arrests while policing the group. It said: “We have made 10 arrests while policing this protest group. They originally gathered at Canary Wharf and then travelled to South Kensington.” Ministers have faced calls to “get a grip” after it emerged flu vaccine deliveries to GPs will be delayed. Appointments for many patients will have to be rescheduled after Seqirus, the largest provider of flu vaccines to the UK, confirmed delays of up to two weeks in England and Wales. The company blamed “unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays” for the delivery disruption, PA reports. GP Online reported the company had sent a letter advising practices not to rebook appointments until they receive confirmation of a new delivery date of vaccine supplies. An apparent exodus of HGV drivers from EU countries, who returned to the continent during the coronavirus pandemic and remained there, has been blamed for disruption in sectors of the economy in recent weeks. A Seqirus spokeswoman said: “Seqirus supplies influenza vaccines to all GP practices in England and Wales. “Due to unforeseen challenges linked with road freight delays, we have informed all our customers of a consequent delay to their scheduled vaccine delivery by a maximum of one to two weeks. “Seqirus is working hard to resolve the delay to allow customers to reschedule their influenza vaccination clinics.” After much deliberation, the government’s independent vaccine advisers concluded that, on the strength of evidence so far, there was a marginal benefit to vaccinating healthy children aged 12 to 15 years old. But that benefit was deemed so very marginal the advisers would not give the green light to mass vaccination of healthy children in the age group. Instead, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) broadened out the existing group of 12- to 15-year-olds eligible for Covid vaccination. Beyond the extremely vulnerable who have already been called forward for shots, the JCVI drew on research from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health to include children with major, chronic heart, lung, kidney and neurological conditions. Children with sickle cell disease and type I diabetes will also be eligible. Consumers have been warned of an autumn rise in living costs from sharp increases in household energy bills and food prices, as Covid and Brexit disruption ripple through the UK economy. Sounding the alarm for a wide range of products and services going up in price, business leaders said the UK was facing a “perfect storm” of worker shortages and problems with global supply chains that would lead to a burst of inflation within months. The warning over the cost of living comes as millions of households face a drop in their income as the government prepares to cut universal credit by £20 a week from 6 October and close the furlough wage subsidy scheme, in moves charities warn will push more people into poverty. Rebecca McDonald, senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Millions of families are facing mounting stress and anxiety about how they will cover the cost of living as the planned cut to universal credit rapidly approaches. Here is a brief summary of all the big coronavirus news from so far today: The UK government’s vaccines watchdog has decided there is not enough evidence to recommend the rollout of Covid vaccines to all 12- to 15-year-olds, but has held open the possibility of ministers seeking other advice to go ahead nonetheless. In Denmark, the country’s health minister Magnus Heunicke has announced residents in nursing homes will get a third shot of the Covid vaccine, starting next week. The UK government has announced 121 more Covid deaths in the past 24 hours. The US government’s plan to roll out additional shots of the coronavirus vaccine for the general public on September 20 will proceed with just the Pfizer vaccine, a source familiar with the discussion said on Friday. Italy’s prime minister has announced his government could make Covid vaccines mandatory, sparking a row in the country that has seen a recent rise in protests and violence from anti-vaxxers. Spain’s two-week Covid rate fell below 200 cases per 100,000 people for the first time in over two months, according to its health ministry. In the United States, Joe Biden has said he will set out his administration’s next steps to combat the coronavirus Delta variant next week. North Korea leader Kim Jong-un has ordered officials to wage a tougher epidemic prevention campaign in “our style” after he turned down some foreign vaccines offered via the UN-backed immunisation programme. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. I’m now handing over to my colleague Nadeem Badshah, who will keep you across all the latest Covid news tonight. Healthcare workers in Hawaii say a lack of government action is worsening the coronavirus crisis in the islands. They say that without effective policy changes the state’s limited hospitals could face a grim future. “Soon we’re going to be in a situation where we’re going to ration health care,” said Dr. Jonathan Dworkin, an infectious diseases specialist in Hawaii. Dworkin said that while mandates may be unpopular, rationing Hawaii’s limited health care resources is “going to be far more ugly.” “It involves making decisions about who lives and dies,” he said. “I hate the idea of having to make a decision about who’s going to get oxygen.” Dworkin added that another stay-at-home order may be needed. Spain’s two-week Covid rate fell below 200 cases per 100,000 people for the first time in over two months, according to its health ministy. The 14-day infection rate was 198, the first time it has dipped below 200 cases since July 2, Reuters reported. The health ministry said 71.5% of the population are fully vaccinated, while 39.4% of people aged 12 to 19 have received both doses of a vaccine. Since the pandemic started, 4,877,755 people have tested positive for Covid in Spain while the death toll rose to 84,795 on Friday, the health ministry said. In the UK, police have prevented anti-vaccine protesters from storming the headquarters of Britain’s medical regulator amid violent clashes in east London. At least four officers were injured and arrests were made during a confrontation as hundreds of people gathered outside the offices of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in Canary Wharf. Police drew batons and called for reinforcements as protesters attempted to force open the door of the regulator’s offices, with security guards looking on from inside. Some of the crowd who had gathered at Canary Wharf were later involved in another confrontation outside the Science Museum vaccination centre in Kensington, west London. “A number of protesters have become violent towards police,” the Metropolitan police said on Twitter after the confrontation in east London. “Four of our officers have been injured during clashes. This is unacceptable. We remain on scene.” The protests are understood to have been organised by activists angered by reports that the Covid-19 vaccination campaign could be extended to younger age groups. The US government’s plan to roll out additional shots of the coronavirus vaccine for the general public on September 20 will proceed with just the Pfizer vaccine, a source familiar with the discussion said on Friday. Moderna’s booster submission was found inadequate and the US Food and Drug Administration and requires stronger data from the company, reports the Reuters news agency. It makes the process likely to be a few weeks behind that of Pfizer/BioNTech, the source added. Italy’s prime minister has announced his government could make Covid vaccines mandatory, sparking a row in the country that has seen a recent rise in protests and violence from anti-vaxxers. During a press conference on Thursday, Mario Draghi said all Italians of eligible age could soon be obliged to get a shot, as soon as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gives its conditional approval for four vaccines. The news sparked protests by anti-vaxxers who, in recent days, have sent death threats to members of the government, virologists, health officials and journalists, because of their pro-vax stances. Prosecutors in Turin on Tuesday have launched an investigation into an antivax chat group on Telegram, where members posted death threats against foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio. A bit more on those jobs statistics mentioned in the Joe Biden press conference earlier this afternoon. The US economy added just 235,000 jobs in August, a sharp drop from preceding months, as employers cut back hiring plans amid the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus virus. The unemployment rate declined by 0.2 percentage points to 5.2% from 5.4% in July and has fallen dramatically from a high of 14.7% in April last year. So far this year, monthly US job growth has averaged 586,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But August’s hiring slowdown was unexpected. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a gain of 725,000 jobs for August, after surging over 1m in July. With companies increasingly recognising that pandemic-induced burnout is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed, what are the signs and what can frazzled workers do to help recovery? My colleague Alexandra Topping has been speaking to Dr Rajvinder Samra, a psychologist and lecturer in health at the Open University, who describes burnout as “the effects of chronic and acute stress over long periods of time”. For the full story, click below. In the United States, Joe Biden has said he will set out his administration’s next steps to combat the coronavirus Delta variant next week. He also called the US economic recovery “durable and strong”. “We need to make more progress in fighting the Delta variant,” Biden said in remarks from the White House. However, earlier today Reuters reported the US economy created the fewest jobs in seven months in August as hiring in the leisure and hospitality sector stalled amid a resurgence in Covid infections. But other details of the Labor department’s closely watched employment report on Friday were fairly strong, with the unemployment rate falling to a 17-month low of 5.2% and July job growth revised sharply higher. Wages increased a solid 0.6% and fewer people were experiencing long spells unemployment. The UK government has announced 121 more Covid deaths in the past 24 hours. This represents a drop from 178 deaths related to coronavirus on Thursday. The latest data also confirmed a further 42,076 people tested positive for Covid. The UK government’s vaccines watchdog has decided there is not enough evidence to recommend the rollout of Covid vaccines to all 12- to 15-year-olds, but has held open the possibility of ministers seeking other advice to go ahead nonetheless. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended an expansion of the group of children with health conditions that makes them clinically vulnerable. They should receive two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, as they are more at risk of the virus. The committee said that with a rate of just two per million of healthy children needing intensive care treatment for Covid, the marginal benefit of vaccinating them was “insufficient to support a universal offer” of vaccines to the age group. One issue is the very small risk of myocarditis, a form of heart inflammation, in children who receive the vaccine. While this is extremely rare, and children tend to recover quickly, there was uncertainty about any longer-term effects, with further research needed. However, the JCVI has left ministers – who are under intense pressure to begin the children’s vaccinations as schools in England return this week – with the option of overruling the watchdog. The JCVI’s decision notes that it is not within its remit to consider wider issues such as disruption to education and wider community transmission, and has agreed that ministers can seek advice on this elsewhere. The chief medical officers of the four UK nations will be asked for their views, with the hope of a UK-wide policy being formed. It is understood the JCVI made the decision by a majority vote on Thursday, following lengthy discussions and debate. The UK has sent coronavirus vaccines to delegates attending the COP26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland, next month. The government has already sent the first batch of shots to delegates and they will start arriving next week, targeting those who cannot access vaccines at home. “Vaccines are shipping and vaccination will begin next week and through mid-September before second jabs in October well ahead of COP26,” British COP26 envoy John Murton said on Twitter on Friday. He did not specify where the vaccines would be sent or how many are being shipped. The COP26 conference, postponed from last year, takes place from October 31 to November 12. Delegates from more than 190 countries would typically attend the annual talks but with Covid still affecting many poorer countries, it is thought some country’s will not send delegates. South Africa will leave it up to businesses to choose if they want to make vaccinations mandatory for their employees and clients, the country’s health minister said today. Restaurants, bars, grocery stores and other businesses must set their own policies on whether or not to insist consumers ought to be vaccinated, Joe Phaahla said on Friday. He added: It is not our priority to start thinking about legislation and regulations which say every adult must vaccinate. We leave it to those who run industries and services. The government plans to encourage people to get inoculated with incentives such as allowing soccer matches and music concerts for vaccinated people, he said. Currently, such public gatherings are not permitted under Covid restrictions. Other ways to promote vaccines are currently being discussed by the department of health, he said. Some South African companies have announced that they will make vaccinations mandatory for all employees, Reuters said. In Denmark, the country’s health minister Magnus Heunicke has announced residents in nursing homes will get a third shot of the Covid vaccine, starting next week. He says Denmark has seen an increase in cases in nursing homes, despite 96% of the people living there getting vaccinated. “At the same time, they have the greatest risk of a serious course,” Heunicke wrote on Twitter. The government acted on a recommendation by the Danish Health Authority, which says the “re-vaccination of residents in nursing homes starts now, as they are at increased risk of a serious course of Covid-19.” The epicentre of Vietnam’s Covid crisis, Ho Chi Minh City, is considering abandoning its strict lockdown from September 15. The city previously had operated a “zero Covid” strategy but now appears to be targeting a policy of living with the virus. The city of 9 million people is targeting a phased reopening and the full vaccination of its citizens by the end of this year, according to the draft plan seen by Reuters, which has yet to be endorsed. Ho Chi Minh City last month deployed troops to enforce its lockdown and prohibited residents from leaving their homes to slow a spiralling rate of deaths. Just 3% of Vietnam’s 98 million population has been fully vaccinated. Vietnam’s biggest city, a business hub flanked by industrialised provinces, aims to “promote economic recovery ... and move towards living with Covid-19,” the draft proposal said. The reopening would be gradual, and low-interest loans and tax cuts would be offered to affected firms, it said. Ho Chi Minh City alone has recorded 241,110 coronavirus infections and 9,974 deaths, representing half of the country’s cases and 80% of its fatalities. It might come as a surprise that people look back fondly at lockdown, but 54% of people in the UK say they will miss at least some aspects of a life closer to home. So, what will we miss most? My colleague Rachel Hall has the full report. The US plans to send more than 1.2m doses of coronavirus vaccines to four different African countries as part of the Covax programme. A White House official told Reuters that the shipment is set to include 250,320 doses of the Moderna vaccine for the Democratic Republic of Congo, 657,080 Moderna doses for Uganda, 302,400 doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine for Guinea and 35,100 doses of the vaccine made by Pfizer/BioNTech for Seychelles. The doses are being delivered through Covax, jointly run by the World Health Organization and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. South Africa’s health minister, Joe Phaahla, has said scientists have told the government that at this stage the C.1.2 coronavirus variant detected is not a threat. First identified in May, the variant has now been recorded in all of the country’s nine provinces. The Reuters news agency reports: It contains some mutations associated in other variants with increased transmission and reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies, leading researchers to flag its detection to the government and the World Health Organization (WHO). “At this stage they [scientists] have assured us it’s not really a threat, they are just watching it,” Phaahla told a news conference, adding that C.1.2 had only been detected in small numbers so far. He said it was almost certain that the country would face a fourth wave of Covid cases towards the end of the year. In Australia, the state of New South Wales has reported 1,431 new Covid cases while 12 people have died from the virus, as the state premier, Gladys Berejiklian, warned cases were likely to peak over the next fortnight. An unvaccinated woman aged in her 30s was among the dead. The woman, identified as mother-of-four Jamila Yaghi, died in her Guildford home on Wednesday, one day after testing positive for the virus. While investigations are under way to determine if she had underlying conditions, it is understood authorities were trying to understand how long the woman had been symptomatic before getting tested and seeking care. Despite the case record on Friday, Berejiklian said health authorities expected cases to continue to grow and peak over the coming two weeks. She said this aligned with a predicted peak in hospitalisation in October, because of a lag between initial infection and serious sickness that requires hospitalisation, adding: The next fortnight is likely to be our worst in terms of the number of cases, but as I have said it is not the number of cases we need to be focusing on, but how many of those cases end up in our intensive care wards and hospitals and how many people we have vaccinated as quickly as possible. More on those ONS statistics coming in for England today. The overall picture masks regional differences: the survey shows that the percentage of people testing positive increased in the south-west of England and West Midlands in the most recent week, but decreased in London and the east Midlands. There are also age disparities, with infection rate having risen in those aged 70 and older – despite remaining low – and early signs of an increase in those aged 25-34. By contrast, rates are showing some signs of falling in younger adults, from school year 12 to age 24. Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said the results findings show a mixed picture of infection rates across the UK. She adds: While rates are level overall in England, we are seeing a possible impact of the holiday season in the south-west as infections are among their highest estimated rates. Meanwhile, however, infections have decreased in London and the east Midlands. In Scotland we are seeing our highest estimate of infections since we started collecting data last autumn with a notably sharp increase recorded in the week to 28 August. Meanwhile, in England, the prevalence of coronavirus infections was around 1 in 70 people in the week ending 27 August, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figure remains unchanged from the previous week’s estimate. One in 70 is the equivalent of about 766,100 people. At the peak of the second wave in early January, about one in 50 people in England were estimated to have coronavirus. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 is estimated to have increased in south-west England and the West Midlands, the ONS said. London and the east Midlands reported a decrease, while the trend for all other regions is uncertain. Yorkshire and the Humber had the highest proportion of people of any region likely to test positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 August, about one in 55. The east Midlands, eastern England and London had the lowest estimate: about one in 85. Some breaking news coming in from Brussels this morning. Europe’s medicines regulator has said it is reviewing cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome after inoculation with Covid vaccines, following a report of a similar case with Pfizer/BioNTech’s shot. The European Medicines Agency’s safety committee is also looking into cases of rare blood clots in the vein with Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine, the regulator said, adding that the issue was distinct from a rare side-effect identified earlier. China is facing “increasingly difficult” problems in expanding its mass coronavirus vaccination effort, a health official has said. However, it has vowed to press on with plans to inoculate more people, as well as ramping up its booster jab programme. Zheng Zhongwei, an official at the National Health Commission, did not say what obstacles the government was facing but said those who have not been vaccinated could not rely on being protected by those who have had the shots. It comes amid concerns over the highly transmissible Delta variant sweeping China. “Recently, as [pushing vaccination work] came to the later stage, it has become increasingly difficult,” Zheng said at a health forum. He said China has given full doses to about 900 million people, or more than 60% of its 1.4 billion population, but cited some experts saying China may need a vaccination rate higher than 80%. China administered around 13 million doses per day on average in July and August, slower than June’s daily average of 19 million, according to Reuters. An agreement has been reached between the European Union and AstraZeneca over the delivery of pending vaccine doses. It comes after months of argument played out in public over the company’s European vaccine production and the bloc’s vaccination campaign. Under the settlement, AstraZeneca has committed to deliver 60 million doses of its vaccine, Vaxzevria, by the end of the third quarter this year, 75 million by the end of the fourth quarter and 65 million by the end of the first quarter of 2022. The dispute plunged the EU into crisis earlier this year as states, under pressure to speed up vaccinations, scrambled for shots. It also caused a public relations crisis for AstraZeneca, which is led by the Frenchman Pascal Soriot, reported Reuters. Brussels has since reduced its reliance on the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, with vaccine supplies coming from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The EU’s executive body said that under the new agreement, member states would be provided with regular delivery schedules and if there were any delayed doses, capped rebates would be applied. Good morning, I’m Tom Ambrose and will be keeping you abreast of all the developing Covid news throughout the afternoon. We start with the news that, in Indonesia, an online leak of the president’s coronavirus vaccine certificate has heightened concern about information security. It comes in the same week as a data breach affecting 1.3 million users of a government contact-tracing application, the Reuters news agency reports. President Joko Widodo’s vaccine records were accessed using the app, PeduliLindungi, and shared widely on social media. Digital analyst Ismail Fahmi said the leak showed how easy it was to view or potentially use another individual’s vaccination certificate. He said: If there was protection, there would be an investigation into why this problem persists, why personal records can be easily mined. But there is no such protection. The health minister, Budi Gunadi Sadikin, has since confirmed officials’ records could no longer be accessed. Summary Here’s a brief roundup of the last few hours of coronavirus news: The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said he wants to work with the government in Pakistan to see if the country can come off the red travel list. Children’s rights groups have called for an end to Covid regulations that restrict family visits and access to education in the youth detention system. As schools return after summer across Europe, some countries with lower vaccination rates have decided to postpone reopening. Rates are particularly low in some Balkan countries including Kosovo and Albania. UK ministers are reported to be preparing to extend emergency Covid legislation this autumn. Covid jab technology will help fight cancer, scientists have revealed. Parental consent could be required, it is being reported, as the UK independent vaccine body JCVI weighs up whether to say 12- to 15-year-olds should get vaccinated. That’s it from me Harriet Grant, I’m handing over to my colleague Tom Ambrose. The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said he wants to see Pakistan come off the government’s red list for travel restrictions. He told a press conference in Pakistan – where he is in talks about the future of Afghanistan – that he would work with the government to “find a way through”. Raab said: “We do understand that this is a sensitive issue and a difficult issue. We base our decision on the technical evidence. I understand that is often contested, which is all the more reason why it’s good that the Pakistan special adviser to Prime Minister Khan will be holding expert level talks with UK public health authorities. “We want to find a way through, no one wants Pakistan off the red list more than I do, but we take these decisions at a technical level. I think the smart thing for us to do is work together to enable that to happen as soon, as safely and as responsibly it can be done.” Call to end Covid restrictions on young people in custody Rights groups have written to the UK justice secretary, Robert Buckland, asking him to end harsh Covid regulations that restricted family visits and access to education for young people in prison. In a letter published this morning the groups Article 39 and the Howard League say children in custody have “suffered greatly” during the pandemic. They write: “[L]egal protections for children in custody were last year watered down overnight without any consultation or parliamentary debate. With the majority of coronavirus restrictions lifted within the community, vaccinations now available for teenagers aged 16 and 17, and schools reopening, we write to ask that the statutory instruments made in May and July 2020 be revoked, and children’s entitlements to education and family visits be reinstated. Children in prison have suffered greatly during the pandemic and should be guaranteed to receive the statutory minimum requirement for education from now on.” They go on to note that children in custody already have far lower levels of literacy than the general population. They also criticise the government for allowing the solitary confinement of under-18’s during lockdown. Some Balkan countries with low vaccination rates are delaying the start of the school term. In a report looking at different approaches to Covid protection in schools around Europe, Associated Press reveals that both Kosovo and Albania have postponed the beginning of the school year. The weekly average of new cases rose by tenfold between July and August in Kosovo where children have a delay of two weeks before they can get back to the classroom. In Albania teachers are now facing mandatory vaccination. Only a third of the population there has been vaccinated with rates even lower in Kosovo. Across the world, authorities are taking a variety of approaches to try and keep children in school and avoid another academic year of disruption. The UK has ended the system of isolation of Covid contacts for children while other countries including France will keep the measure. Earlier this week the World Health Organization and Unicef warned of the “catastrophic” disruption that Covid has caused to children’s learning. They listed precautionary measures that they hoped would let all European schools remain open including better ventilation and regular testing. Sajid Javid has said the delivery of 4m vaccines from the UK to Australia will help the country “supercharge” its vaccine rollout. Earlier we reported that the doses of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines were sent in a swap deal. The UK health secretary said: “Vaccines have built a strong wall of defence in the UK and we want to support nations around the world in recovering from Covid-19 and improving access to vaccines.” Ministers ‘preparing to extend emergency Covid laws’ The FT is reporting unnamed UK government insiders saying that the extension of legislation later this autumn will be necessary. The measures must be voted on every six months and the story reports that the government will renew them because cases across the UK are running high, hospitalisations are rising and a difficult flu season is expected. The insider says: “The Coronavirus Act is going to be one of the trickier bills to pass. We’re gearing up for a fight with our own MPs, who are going to be reluctant to support it.” The story quotes the Tory MP Steve Baker, who has consistently opposed stringent Covid laws, as saying: “We are going to have to learn to live with this virus, and retaining sweeping powers of detention in the Coronavirus Act is not consistent with this. What justification can there be for extending these measures?” Fellow Tory MP Mark Harper argued that any unforeseen events could be covered with existing legislation. “Parliament can already give the police emergency powers under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, but these regulations only last up to 30 days, require almost immediate parliamentary approval and involve judicial oversight.” Labour has in the past backed the laws and would be likely to do so again. Covid jab tech will help fight cancer Scientists have been talking this morning about the news that the technology behind the Covid vaccine could help fight cancer. Researchers have designed a two-dose vaccine they hope can target tumours in humans. In order to create the treatment, scientists designed their vaccine to target proteins that are present on the surface of many types of cancer cells. When tested in mice, the vaccine increased the numbers of anti-tumour T cells that attack cancerous growths, helping to increase survival rates. The team at Oxford University now have the go-ahead to do human trials. Prof Benoit Van den Eynde told Sky News: “The vaccine technology based on viral vector is extremely powerful. In recent years we have had a new approach to treat cancer … immunotherapy … it has had remarkable results. But some patients immune system doesn’t respond. So … the idea here is to use a vaccine based on the Oxford technology to really to teach the immune system how to recognise cancer cells.” Schools in France reopened to 12 million students this week with all children over the age of six wearing masks. Associated Press reports this morning that the measures are seen as key to keeping schools open. The vaccine is available in France to over 12s, with consent needed from one parent for under 16s. The vaccination programme is going well, with more than 63% of teenagers aged 12-17 having received at least one shot, and 47% fully vaccinated. In French primary schools, if one child tests positive for the virus, the class closes for seven days. In middle and high schools, children who test positive and those who aren’t vaccinated and have been in contact with them will be placed into isolation for at least one week. Those fully vaccinated will be allowed to keep going to school. France is one of the countries around the world that has maintained the highest rate of in-person classes during the Covid-19 crisis. The country closed its schools completely or partially for 12 weeks between March 2020 and July this year, compared with 38 weeks in neighbouring Germany and 58 weeks in the US, according to Unesco figures. Parents consent could be required for 12-15s to have jab The Times is reporting this morning that parents will need to give their written permission for under 15s to get the Covid vaccination. Previous suggestions had been that children would be able to decide for themselves if they wanted the jab. The development is reported to be part of attempts to bring parents onboard with the plans to vaccinate younger teens. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is said to wants schools to follow procedures used for routine childhood immunisation programmes. This would mean schools sending out consent forms and not vaccinating unless they are returned. The Times quotes Prof Helen Bedford of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health saying that this was likely to defuse the potential for rows, with nurses phoning parents who did not return forms to discuss concerns. She says: “In practice, most [vaccinations] are given by school nurses and it’s very unlikely, if you know for certain the parent doesn’t want it, that you would go ahead.” A decision is yet to be made by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on whether children aged 12-15 will be vaccinated. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone for today. I’m handing over to my UK colleague, Harriet Grant. Before I go, here’s a brief roundup of Covid-related news from the past 24 hours: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered officials to wage a tougher epidemic prevention campaign in “our style” after he turned down some foreign Covid-19 vaccines offered via the UN-backed immunisation program. Australia has secured 4m doses of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines in a swap deal with Britain, the prime minister Scott Morrison has said, as he attempts to convince states and territories to stick to a national reopening plan. New Zealand has reported 28 new cases of coronavirus in the community, a drop of 21 compared with the previous day, in an “encouraging” sign that the country’s lockdown is working, deputy prime minister Grant Robertson has said. Boris Johnson has said the UK needs to “go faster” with the vaccination of 16- to 17-year olds, despite a “strong” uptake within the age group, while a decision on extending vaccinations to 12- to 15-year-olds is expected to be announced imminently, the Guardian understands. The US plans to invest $3bn (£2.2bn) in the vaccine supply chain as it continues to work to position the US as a leading supplier of vaccines for the world, Reuters reports. The European Union has agreed to send millions of coronavirus vaccine doses made in South Africa back to the continent, AFP reports. Schoolchildren in France returned from their summer holidays to be told to get vaccinated by headteachers and the French president Emmanuel Macron. Members of the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have been sent suspicious packages and hate mail throughout the pandemic, one of the UK’s leading virologists has revealed. The popular US podcast host Joe Rogan has tested positive for Covid-19 and is taking ivermectin, a drug more commonly used as a veterinary deworming agent, to treat it. India has reported 45,352 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Friday, with 366 deaths. Total infections have now risen to 32.9 million and deaths to 439,895. In case you missed it, Guardian Australia has been running a new series that aims to give a voice to people from all walks of life who are adapting to changing circumstances in the coronavirus pandemic. In this latest dispatch, reporter Mostafa Rachwani spoke to a supermarket manager and a postman: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered officials to wage a tougher epidemic prevention campaign in “our style” after he turned down some foreign Covid-19 vaccines offered via the UN-backed immunisation program, according to the Associated Press. During a Politburo meeting on Thursday, Kim said officials must “bear in mind that tightening epidemic prevention is the task of paramount importance which must not be loosened even a moment”, the official Korean Central News Agency reported on Friday. KCNA said Kim “called for fully providing material and technical means necessary for strengthening epidemic prevention, enhancing the professional qualifications and roles of the officials in the field of epidemic prevention and further rounding off our style epidemic prevention system.” Kim had previously called for North Koreans to brace for prolonged Covid-19 restrictions, indicating the nation’s borders would stay closed despite worsening economic and food conditions. Since the start of the pandemic, North Korea has used tough quarantines and border closures to prevent outbreaks, though its claim to be entirely virus-free is widely doubted. Australia has secured 4m doses of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines in a swap deal with Britain, prime minister Scott Morrison has said, as he tries to speed up the country’s re-opening efforts. “The plane is on the tarmac now. It will be leaving tomorrow ... this will enable us to bring forward significantly the opportunity for Australia to open up again,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra, days after announcing a smaller vaccine swap agreement with Singapore. Morrison has been criticised for failing to initially secure an adequate supply of vaccines and for a slow roll out which has seen initial vaccination targets delayed by months. State governments say their vaccination programmes are being hindered by a lack of supply of the Pfizer vaccine needed to inoculate the younger population. The announcement came as the state of New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, reported its worst day of the pandemic, with a record 1,431 cases and 12 new deaths. State premier Gladys Berejiklian warned residents to brace for a spike in numbers as the next two weeks would “likely to be our worst in terms of the number of cases”. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Livingstone. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered officials to wage a tougher epidemic prevention campaign in “our style” after he turned down some foreign Covid-19 vaccines offered via the UN-backed immunisation program.

article101,The first time I’ve enjoyed cycling in a city: my Tour de Copenhagen,2022-06-30 06:00:31,"['Copenhagen holidays', 'Denmark holidays', 'Cycling holidays', 'Cycling', 'Scandinavia holidays', 'Europe holidays', 'Tour de France', 'Travel', 'Sport', 'City breaks', 'Short breaks']","This is the first time I’ve actually enjoyed cycling in a city. Previously I have been a car-watcher on two wheels, a fume-breathing pothole dodger, my existence begrudged by every four-wheeled, “proper” road user. Now, just outside the Tivoli Gardens, an older lady shoots past me on a shopper-chopper with a cheery “Hihi”, which alerts me to the fact that I am on the wrong side of the bike lane. Imagine: a bike lane broad enough to allow safe overtaking. At the traffic lights there is a purpose-built leaning rail so my feet remain on the pedals; once across the junction, there is a waste bin specially angled to catch litter from cyclists. In the light of this initiation, I am amazed that the Tour de France has never previously hit Copenhagen or Denmark, but 2022 is genuinely the first time. The lord mayor of the city, Sophie Hæstorp Andersen, tells me: “For us Copenhageners, cycling is a way of life, and we are proud to be called the world’s best cycling city. I’ve been watching the Tour since I was a girl and now, like the rest of Denmark, I can’t wait to see the riders in town.” All those soigneurs, grimpeurs, rouleurs and possibly even the rare stagiaire will be swooping around these streets before heading out for two more stages in the countryside (check out James Witherell’s book Bicycle History for wonderful jargon). This July will also see a relaunch of the women’s Tour, which starts in Paris – an event that has had a fitful history since its inception in 1955, but hopefully will finally ignite the public imagination. We start at the Torvehallerne covered market, to stock up on cake, smørrebrød and coffee. My guides, Christian and Roman from Cycling Copenhagen, point out that everyone cycles – even four-year-olds ride to school in their capital city, something for which I imagine a UK parent would be prosecuted. “Cycling here is part of the hygge mentality,” says Christian. “We want to feel awake and healthy in the morning.” Our plan is to follow the route of the Tour’s time trial, taking diversions. First stop is Queen Louise Bridge, said to be the world’s busiest bike route, where a digital counter tells us how many cyclists have passed this way in the previous four months: about 1.2 million. We watch them pass, and it is the demeanour that strikes me, the confidence and vigour with which they cycle. Here’s a young couple, she laughing in the wooden cargo box while he pedals, then a glamorous rider in crocodile-skin boots and tailored robes followed by several earnest young musicians with instruments. There are no hi-vis vests or helmets and, because the bike lanes are clean, no special gear to ward off scrapes and scummy puddles. Next to Parken, the football stadium, where we pause to watch some four-year-olds getting trained on a purpose-built replica of city streets, complete with traffic lights and an angled bin. It takes planning to make utopia, something Christian is keen to point out. “We had a bike culture from the beginning – our first bike lane was built in 1908. But the architect, Jan Gehl, made a lot of the important innovations.” Gehl brought in bike lanes separated by a kerb, a vital development, and also street parking that put a line of cars between traffic and bikes. With buses, taxis and trains all capable of carrying bikes, clear intersections, plentiful bike-parking, and a six-second bike advantage at all traffic lights, it is no wonder that over a third of Copenhagen residents commute by bicycle: it’s faster. The best-known Copenhagen icon, the Little Mermaid statue, will be the location for the first test for the Tour’s pro cyclists, with some sharp turns near it, then there will be a cobbled section through the Amalienborg royal palace. (Yes, the Danish royals cycle too, sometimes taking the kids to school in the cargo box.) There’s a sharp right on the cobbles outside the house of Frederik, the crown prince. We head past the church and up to the Botanical Gardens to see the mangrove forest and palm house. Over the next few days, I explore further afield. There are elegant bike bridges here that link the city across its central waterway to the suburb island of Amager, and radically cut journey times compared with cars. Taking one such bridge I explore the hippy haven of Christiania, now mostly a sleepy waterside labyrinth of fascinating DIY homes. There is a whiff of its former anarchic glory in the market place where drugs are openly sold, and muscled youths with big dogs suggest a darker side. Copenhagen’s cultural resurgence has been led by this northern end of Amager island, an area that was once port facilities or military zones, but is now filled with interesting restaurants, cafes and leisure facilities – all done in inimitably creative style. The Amager Bakke eco-power station also houses the world’s tallest climbing wall and a ski slope (it is possible to climb the 80m wall and ski down). Out here you will find Noma, consistently voted the world’s greatest restaurant, and its many spin-off progeny, including its burger joint POPL. As you might expect in Denmark, there is nothing formal or snobbish about it, just great burgers – and it is perfectly placed for cyclists near the Inderhavns bike bridge. Amass Fried Chicken, despite the name, is more of a place to dress up a bit. At Bistro Lupa we get foraged vegan food. “Have you ever tried cowslips?” asks Jason, the owner, who then serves up a tremendous feast of delicate and unexpected flavours. The pandemic, he tells me, gave him the opportunity to develop a whole new array of dishes. The next day, when I meet Anders Mielke, the man behind popular local bike podcast Forhjulslir, he also points to an unexpected benefit of the pandemic. “If anything, it has increased the city’s love for cycling,” he says, “People have formed little cycle groups and clubs. Now the excitement about the Tour coming is more than ever.” The Tour de France will do three stages in Denmark – 1 July in the capital, 2 and 3 July further into the country – before heading off into France. But in my opinion, the yellow jersey will not go with them: it will stay in its natural home, Copenhagen. The trip was supported by Visit Denmark. Kevin Rushby stayed at Absalon Hotel (doubles from about £130) near the central station, with bikes available. Cycling Copenhagen runs a variety of guided city tours from about £40. Travel transfers and car parking were provided by Holiday Extras, which also provides travel and medical insurance"
article102,An independent Scotland could turn to Denmark for inspiration | Ian Jack,2021-04-17 07:00:27,"['Scotland', 'Denmark', 'Europe', 'UK news', 'Scottish politics']","What kind of country should Scotland be and how can it prosper? Surprisingly, given the swell of Scottish opinion in favour of independence, these questions aren’t much discussed. A swirling mist obscures the road beyond the referendum, occasionally lit up by neon signs reading “green” and “fair” and “free”. Independence, like Brexit, is predicted by its supporters to have a galvanising effect. Few are as gung-ho as Alex Salmond, who estimates that Scotland is one of the world’s richest countries, the “Saudi Arabia of renewables”. Nonetheless, despite the contrary evidence of a recent economic forecast by the London School of Economics, a view prevails that any damage will be easily overcome. In the words of the scientist and engineer Hillary Sillitto, there has always been “lots of talk about a better, fairer society [and] none about where the wealth was going to come from to pay for it”. Last month Sillitto and two other Edinburgh-based writers – another reputable scientist, Ian Godden, and a nurse-turned-entrepreneur, Dorothy Godden – published an online edition of their book, Scotland 2070, which aims to rectify what the writers identify as “the poor quality and short-term perspective of Scotland’s political debate”. Avowedly detached from political parties, they warn against conventional solutions such as inward investment and low corporate taxes: the first is a poor substitute for the development of local industry, and the second is already well-catered for by Ireland. Instead they propose that Scotland looks north rather than south, to the Arctic’s melting icecap and the new east-west sea route that will open up off the northern coasts of Russia, shortening the traditional voyage via Suez between (say) Yokohama and Rotterdam by nearly 5,000 nautical miles. “Within 25 years,” they write, “Scotland will be on the doorstep of a major new global trading passage and a new economic region in the Arctic.” The old naval anchorage in the Orkneys, Scapa Flow, could be filled again with shipping as “a container port and transit facility to rival Singapore” – the centrepiece of a six-point plan that also includes planting Scotland with 5bn trees; adopting new farming techniques that reduce the atmosphere’s carbon content; exporting renewable energy and technology; and, perhaps the hardest to achieve, transforming Scottish industry by doubling university spending on research and development. They say that with hard work and proper funding over the next 50 years, Scottish manufacturing could recover from its near total destruction by globalisation and under-investment. This is Scotland as Scandinavia, a version of the future that has been tickling Scottish political appetites since the 1960s. In the words of Sillitto and his co-authors, “many Scots like the cohesive and egalitarian social models of the small Nordics which lead the world in many economic and wellbeing indices”. Sillitto wants Scotland to emulate their industrial innovation, their social policies and their “hard, focused work ethic”. The two places have a long connection. Several parts of Scotland, particularly the northern and western isles, were colonised by Norse and other Scandinavian settlers between the 8th and the 15th centuries; voyages across the North Sea – coal, salt and herring out, timber by return – were the trade routes that mattered most to Scotland until the late 18th century, when industry and empire moved the focus of energy from the Forth to the Clyde, from east to west. North Sea oil switched attention back again. At the height of the oil boom, the SNP’s favourite country was Norway, which conserved its revenues in a sovereign wealth fund (as an independent Scotland could have done) rather than using them to finance the social costs of deindustrialisation (as Margaret Thatcher’s government actually did). But now, there being no point crying over exhausted oil, the exemplary country, the newest Not-England to which independence campaigners aspire, is Denmark. The two countries share similar-sized populations and a temperate climate. Each has a glamorous capital city, though Edinburgh is undeniably lovelier and more spectacular. Beyond that, similarities are hard to find. Scotland is nearly twice as large, with a landscape that has appealed to the world’s imagination for at least two centuries. “Spectacular” is not a word associated with Denmark. At its highest it reaches 171 metres above sea level, refusing heights or depths. Statistically and historically, Scotland knows little else. On the left, the high road to Loch Lomond; on the right, the low road to the worst drug-death rate in Europe (and, in western Europe, the lowest life expectancy). There is Morningside … and there is Greenock. The long, corrupting reach of history is to blame. The reason for the contrast with Denmark – where, to condense the statistics, people pay more tax to live more equally, happily and soberly, for longer – lies in two different experiences of the industrial revolution. It came to Scotland early, swiftly and savagely. The historian Tom Devine has written that between 1760 and 1830 “Scottish urbanisation was faster than probably anywhere else in Europe … and the rate of growth simply overwhelmed the contemporary structures of sanitation and amenity in a great rising tide of humanity.” Inadequate sewerage, squalid housing, disease, the continuing surge of poor migrants from the Highlands and Ireland: Glasgow’s notoriety was established in those years. Industrialism reached Denmark much later, in the 19th century’s second half, and its factories never scarred the country as the iron forges, steel mills, collieries, shipyards and heavy engineering workshops did Lowland Scotland, transforming a peripheral little country into a great industrial power. Denmark invested more modestly and shrewdly: breweries, shipbuilding, marine diesel engines (which their Danish makers pioneered). After German and Italian unification, Denmark became the smallest state in western and central Europe. Excepting Iceland and the Faroes, it had no secure colonial markets – it had abandoned its little outposts in India and Africa by 1850 – which meant that, unlike Scottish and British industry, it never suffered their confounding loss. Like Germany and Japan, Denmark might be said to owe its successful society to a national humiliation. In 1863, for famously complicated reasons including the view of romantic nationalism that national boundaries should be determined by language, it laid claim to the duchy of Schleswig. All hell broke loose. Austria and Prussia, then under Otto von Bismarck’s leadership, declared war and within six months inflicted a crushing defeat on Denmark that shrank the size of its population and territory – the opposite of its intention. In the description of the historian Bo Lidegaard, the damage to Denmark’s national pride “became a defining national trauma” over several generations. The country turned in on itself. It compensated territorial losses with schemes for land reclamation, turning moors into pastures and conifer plantations, and began to specialise in dairy produce and animal husbandry, happy to boast that it supplied Britain with so many breakfasts. Many of its new dairy farms were run as co-operatives. Again to quote Lidegaard, the co-op movement developed into “both an important feature of society and a centrepiece of Danish self-perception … a strong model for social progress through co-operative action rather than through social confrontation”. Nationalism had been a fragile glory. The serious inspiriting of the nation needed certain conditions and a certain time. When will Scotland be like Denmark? In 50 years or a hundred? If it happens, it will have been worth the wait. Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"
article103,Denmark and rainbow-lit stadiums have shown the way forward on inclusion | Philip Lahm,2021-06-25 11:05:47,"['Euro 2020', 'Denmark', 'Finland', 'England', 'Germany', 'Hungary', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","A European Championship always reflects the way we in Europe shape our lives together. Four things in particular have stood out to me so far in this tournament. On 12 June the continent felt close to a Danish football player. Christian Eriksen had to be resuscitated on the pitch. His teammates, who immediately formed a circle around him, intuitively knew how to stand by him in this stressful situation. It was palpable how much his privacy was worth to them and they protected his dignity in a difficult hour. It was an enormously moving event. The collective sympathy of everyone in the stadium in Copenhagen, Danes and Finns alike, was deep – including those who had been fearing for Eriksen’s life from afar. The next game was interrupted in his honour in the 10th minute, and everyone applauded, including opponents and referees. After the final whistle Denmark’s coach, Kasper Hjulmand, and the Belgian player Romelu Lukaku, who dedicated his goal to his Internazionale teammate Eriksen in the previous match, hugged each other. You didn’t need to hear what they were talking about. After the event, many questions arose: what should be shown on television, and what should not? What is reporting? Where does voyeurism begin? Did the people producing the TV feed act responsibly? These discussions revealed the quality of our free community. In Europe, different positions can have the same justification. This includes the Danes’ later criticism of the game being restarted on the night. An international debate also ignited over a political gesture. Teams from England, Wales and Belgium have been kneeling before their games, and at Wembley Scotland did too to show solidarity. With this symbolism from the Black Lives Matter movement, which originated with Colin Kaepernick’s protests against racism, they remind us that we all have equal rights and that these rights are violated again and again. Minorities are discriminated against all over the world. Many people draw strength from the fact that they exclude a group and ascribe negative characteristics to it. That is wrong, and it is also unnecessary. I don’t need an enemy for my identity; I don’t become stronger through exclusion, but through cooperation. In the long run, success in a football team can only be achieved if people accept and appreciate each other’s differences. Of course, that also applies to the opponent. And in football, a foul is a foul, no matter who commits it. The England team have faced racism at a number of away games in recent years. In Bulgaria, there were monkey noises aimed at Tyrone Mings, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford. Now the team are drawing strength from kneeling. Gareth Southgate explained the significance in an open letter to the nation. “It is their duty,” the England coach wrote of his players, “to continue to interact with the public on matters such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice.” The gesture was criticised in some places. One Tory MP said he would boycott England games at the Euros over the gesture, the kneeling Belgians were booed in Budapest and St Petersburg, and some football officials called it “populism”. But the symbol is well established in team sports. It is a strong signal in dealing with other identities that everyone understands. It is an important joint declaration that skin colour does not matter. It is a sign to the outside world, but also a commitment to the inside. The gesture cannot therefore be populist. Another symbol of diversity also caused headlines. The mayor of the city of Munich wanted to illuminate the arena in rainbow colours on the day of the match between Germany and Hungary to send a signal against homophobia and recent Hungarian legislation. Uefa rejected this because the message directly targeted a decision of the parliament and therefore violated the governing body’s requirement for political neutrality. This ban drew a lot of criticism – from the LGBTQ+ community to politically conservative parties. In response, other stadiums in Germany decided to light their arenas that evening out of solidarity. Lastly, Europe still faces the challenge posed to all of us by coronavirus, this time with the Delta variant. How can the tournament be conducted responsibly? How do the various countries support each other? As is well known, the virus does not stop at borders, but only at sensible decisions. These, especially internationally, are not always free of conflict. The Eriksen case has shown what solidarity is all about. That is how civilisation works at its best. The Danes’ team is now acting more than ever as a collective, and their connection to the rest of the country is visibly strengthened. But their sense of togetherness is not directed against anyone. Of course, the European Championship is great fun. But if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. Week by week, day by day, the number of Covid-19 cases and other criteria must be observed. Where the final will be held, whether that is in London as planned or somewhere else, as was under discussion, is secondary. The only answer is: where it is safe. The impact of the virus has been felt by every nation; some earlier, some later, some less, some more. “Public health must be a priority,” says Boris Johnson. In Moscow, the fan zone has been closed. It is clear, of course, that the same rules do not apply everywhere and so Euro 2020 has shown us once again that the countries in Europe have different conditions, and that even a football tournament requires constant negotiation. That is the way it is in democracy. Philipp Lahm’s column appears regularly in the Guardian. It is produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries."
article104,"‘He was gone’: Christian Eriksen had cardiac arrest, Denmark doctor says",2021-06-13 14:26:50,"['Christian Eriksen', 'Denmark', 'Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","Christian Eriksen had a cardiac arrest and “was gone” before being swiftly resuscitated on the pitch, Denmark’s the team doctor, Morten Boesen, revealed on Sunday. “He was gone,” Boesen said. “We started the resuscitation and we managed to do it. How close were we to losing him? I don’t know, but we got him back after one defib [defibrillation], so that’s quite fast.” Denmark’s coach, Kasper Hjulmand, revealed the squad had spoken to Eriksen on Sunday and that it was great “to see him smile”, and Boesen praised the medical team at Parken, where Denmark played Finland. “How quickly they reacted was decisive I would say,” he said. “The time from when it happens until he receives help is the most important factor. And that was a short period of time. That was decisive. “They are now doing a series of tests at the hospital that can maybe give some of the answers him and I are looking for. But he is awake and is answering questions clearly. His heart is beating again … the tests that have been done so far look fine. We don’t have an explanation to why it happened.” Eriksen collapsed during the first half of the Euro 2020 game and after receiving CPR on the pitch was taken to hospital. The game resumed, Finland winning 1-0, the players having decided to continue after hearing that Eriksen was conscious and wanted them to carry on. Hjulmand said in a 45-minute press conference on Sunday that the player could hardly remember anything from the incident but that he was in a good mood when he had a video call with the rest of the squad. Hjulmand said: “Christian was concerned about us and he doesn’t remember a lot about yesterday so he asked how the team was doing. “Christian is a big person. He felt that he can play because he is at his happiest on the pitch. He said this morning that we maybe had it worse than him because he wants to get out on the training pitch again. We have to see if we can gather ourselves and go out and play for Christian.” The television coverage of the incident has drawn widespread criticism from around the world. It included footage of the player as well as his distressed partner, Sabrina Kvist Jensen, but the director responsible for the feed, Jean-Jacques Amsellem, told L’Equipe on Sunday that there was “no handbook for these incidents”. Amsellem said: “There was a slow-motion of the scene where we can see him fall really clearly, but I immediately forced my teams not to focus on him, not to film him anymore. During all the live coverage that followed, I did at one moment show Danes in tears because it was still necessary to show the distress. We also saw the emotions of the Finns and the crowd but I don’t think we did anything mawkish or creepy.” The BBC was criticised for continuing to broadcast the feed and said in a statement on Sunday: “Everyone at the BBC is hoping Christian Eriksen makes a full recovery. We apologise to anyone who was upset by the images broadcast. In stadium coverage is controlled by Uefa as the host broadcaster, and as soon as the match was suspended we took our coverage off air as quickly as possible.”"
article105,James McQuillan’s incredible rise from wheelchair rugby novice to playing for Australia,2022-10-12 16:30:39,"['Disability and sport', 'Paralympics', 'Sport', 'Australia sport']","When James McQuillan was learning to use his wheelchair, he started in a shopping centre, “where it’s all flat”. Then, he says, “you’re on pavements with some gutters that are a bit tricky, and then you go out and about with your friends or to the pub”. The now 29-year-old spent years relearning the logistics of life – and in the first 11 months after an accident on a footy field left him a quadriplegic, he was starting from scratch. “It was not so much about getting to use your arms again,” he says. “It was more just understanding what your body can do – how to have a drink of water, scratch your nose, those sorts of things.” After that he was introduced to a manual chair, and practised bending down to pick objects up off the floor or a table. Eight years later, McQuillan has not only refined these skills to the point he can live and work relatively independently, but has also inhaled some new ones – so swiftly that he is now in Europe representing Australia in wheelchair rugby, just 11 months after taking up the sport. In August the Victorian made his international debut in Denmark, and he is back there this week with the Steelers to contest the world championships that started on Tuesday. To put the speed of McQuillan’s rise into context, he was watching on television as Chris Bond and Ryley Batt led the team at the Tokyo Paralympics, having never even thought about playing wheelchair rugby at a local level. “Turns out I’m in the team with them now, playing in the next major tournament after Tokyo,” he says. “How unusual.” McQuillan had always been sporty. Growing up on a dairy farm near the country Victoria town of Echuca, winters were dedicated to footy and summers cricket. The rest of the year was marking time, waiting for the next season to start. He wasn’t, he says, “particularly outstanding at either”, but loved being part of a team. At school he was the kid teachers said distracted his friends too much in class. A rascal, but a people person. Towards the end of year 12, he met a girl named Kathryn at a party. “She locked eyes on me and couldn’t resist,” he says. “No, it was probably the other way around.” Through coincidence, both had applied to study physiotherapy at university in Albury-Wodonga. When they were accepted, they moved together, and McQuillan started playing footy with the Albury Tigers. McQuillan remembers everything about his accident except for the actual collision. He knows he played the opening quarter of Albury’s first game of the 2014 season – a grand final rematch against local rivals Yarrawonga. He recalls, midway through the second term, putting his head over the footy to pick up the ball, and then running straight into an opposing player’s leg. He does not remember his neck snapping forward on impact, far enough to fracture his C5 vertebrae. About 30 seconds later the then 20-year-old came to. “I was fully conscious, not concussed or anything like that,” he says. “I just had had this horrible burning sensation through my lower body – through my full body, really.” Internally, McQuillan was already self-diagnosing. He knew from his physio course work that paralysis wasn’t a good sign. “I hadn’t paid that much attention in class,” he says, “but I had a fair idea it wasn’t looking particularly good. There was a voice in my head going ‘gee, I hope we’ll just pop down to Melbourne and they’ll fix it up, and we’ll be back doing the normal things in a couple of weeks’. But I think deep down I had a pretty good idea.” So did Kathryn – his now wife – who was on the sideline as one of the match’s trainers. She was one of the first people to reach her partner. That must have been distressing for her, too? “Yeah, I think so,” he says. Then he rephrases. “It definitely was distressing for her – she’s sitting next to me and she’s looking at me going, ‘yep, it was distressing’. Mum and Dad were there, and my younger brother and one of my really good mates, so that was tricky.” At hospital in Albury he spent five days in intensive care, before being placed in an induced coma and airlifted to Melbourne’s Austin hospital. There he spent a month, followed by 11 more months at the Royal Talbot rehabilitation centre “getting used to my new body and learning how to live”. It was where he first noticed some wheelchair rugby players having a “muck-around game” each Wednesday night. There were some life-changing triple nerve transfer surgeries, too. “They took nerves that went to muscles that worked but didn’t do too much, and plugged them into nerves that went to bigger muscles that did more. “Previously, I probably had enough function to do basic tasks, but now I can do things that someone with my level of function – a C5 quadriplegic – wouldn’t normally be able to do very easily. “It doesn’t sound that exciting, but from an independence point of view it’s really helpful if you can pick up a plate of food and carry it over to the table, or shake someone’s hand, or pick up my phone off the floor easily instead of struggling with it for a couple of minutes. It definitely makes me realise how lucky I am.” McQuillan feels positive about much of his new life. His parents and brother have been a constant support, as has Kathryn, who he married in May. And he is part of an inclusive and flexible workplace at ANZ Bank. All while playing his way into the national team. Still, he is self-deprecating. “I’m like the poor man’s Dylan Alcott, basically,” he deadpans. His mother, a retired teacher, and his father, a farmer, have travelled to Denmark to watch their son compete at the world championships. Australia have already made light work of Brazil 57-36 and edged form team Canada 55-53, before defeating the host nation 55-43 on Thursday morning (AEDT) to remain unbeaten. McQuillan is still learning the ropes, having played his first formal games less than a year ago filling in at a local competition, where he was spotted by a couple of Steelers players and invited to join them for training. His disability falls into the 0.5 class – the lowest level of functional ability – meaning his main role is to block and get in the way of opponents to free up his higher-functioning teammates. “There are some crossovers with footy, in terms of positioning on the field and blocking for other people,” he says. “Sometimes I’m not where I’m supposed to be, just because I’m new and still learning. They’ve been really good at teaching me where I need to go. There’s so many different scenarios in rugby that are foreign to me, so it’s taken a bit to get on top of. “I’m just really lucky to have had lots of support that people who were happy to come along with me and help me experience and learn things again. I’ve managed to get to a point where I feel really, really happy with how things are.”"
article106,Danish farmers turn their backs on mink after Covid mutation cull,2022-05-13 11:11:29,"['Environment', 'Coronavirus', 'World news', 'Denmark', 'Farming', 'Animals']","Danish mink breeders have turned their backs on the industry en masse after being forced to cull their animals over fears a Covid-19 mutation could pose a risk to human health. In November 2020, Denmark, at that point the world’s largest mink producer, controversially announced it would cull approximately 15 million animals due to fears a Covid-19 mutation moving from mink to humans could jeopardise future vaccines. The Danish government temporarily banned mink farming and the breeding of the animals for their fur, later extending the ban until 2023. Officials have now said just a handful of producers in the country have chosen to resume business if the ban lifts in 2023. Greece, Poland and North America are now expected to increase production to make up the shortfall. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (FVST) told the Guardian only 13 breeders had applied for the compensation that would allow them to potentially continue breeding mink in 2023. Another 1,246 breeders applied for the compensation to end their mink farming. The FVST said, since the cull, it had found three cases of illegally farmed mink, two in December 2021 and one in February 2022. It added that £2.1bn had been paid out in compensation to the industry after the ban. Denmark’s State Serum Institute (SSI) confirmed that the mutated virus that sparked the cull, known as Cluster 5, is now considered extinct. It has not been detected since September 2020. The Danish government is expected to issue a decision later this month on whether mink breeding can safely restart next year. It remains possible that limited breeding may be allowed. International Fur Federation CEO, Mark Oaten, was upbeat about global mink farming, pointing out that all North American mink have now received Covid-19 vaccinations, and that a European vaccination programme is under way. He was pessimistic, however, about Denmark. Even if breeding is allowed to continue next year, Oaten sees three barriers to its resumption. “The first problem is that the infrastructure has disappeared in Denmark, so it’s very hard to get hold of the feed,” he said. The second difficulty is that the government’s decision on a restart is being made only after the compensation deadline, making any restarts “a huge gamble”. A third factor, he said, is a generational issue, with many farmers reaching retirement age. More broadly, Oaten said it was a “hugely complex time” for the fur sector, with sanctions and lockdowns in two of its biggest markets, Russia and China, coming on top of the Danish mink shortfall of about 10 million pelts. In the longer term, Oaten said: “We are expecting countries like Greece and Poland and North America to help fill that shortfall [of pelts] but that will take a few years.” Nor does Oaten fear further bans in Europe, partly, he said, because of the negative fallout the Danish government faced for its mink cull. Animal welfare campaigners said legislative proposals to ban fur farming are now under consideration across Europe, including in Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria, with compensation being a key issue.

Became more involved in buildup as opponents dropped off. 7 Harry Maguire Usual threat at set pieces and almost powered header past Schmeichel. Composed throughout, but booked for challenge on Kjær. 7 Luke Shaw Conceded the free-kick that rocked England, but defended well thereafter and supported attacks with usual appetite. 7 Kalvin Phillips Struggled to get a grip in first half but improved. Found passing range and came close with daisycutter. 7 Declan Rice Became more aggressive after a tentative first half-hour but never quite assumed control of midfield. 6 Bukayo Saka Quiet start but, as so often, found a precise final ball to create the equaliser. Worked hard to support Walker. 7 Mason Mount Early burst into box showcased energy and endeavour. Plenty of good touches but influence waned in second half. 7 Raheem Sterling Kept coming and coming even when things were not working. Forced Kjær’s own goal and fouled for winning spot-kick. 8 Harry Kane Kept his cool – just about – when handed England’s big moment. Showed vision with superb pass in buildup to leveller. 8 (MOTM) Substitutes: Jack Grealish (for Saka, 69) Raised England’s tempo and had shot repelled by Schmeichel. Replaced in extra time. 7; Jordan Henderson (for Rice, 95) Introduction helped England further extra-time stranglehold. 6; Phil Foden (for Mount, 95) Twisted Denmark in knots as England turned the screw. 7; Kieran Trippier (for Grealish, 105) Assigned to help England hold precious lead. 6 Denmark (3-4-3) Kasper Schmeichel Agonisingly close to breaking England’s hearts with initial penalty save having already performed heroics from Kane, Maguire and Sterling. 8 (MOTM) Andreas Christensen Won free-kick for Damsgaard’s goal and defended with composure before knock eventually forced him off. 7 Simon Kjær Little he could do about equaliser with Sterling challenging. Led by example despite whack from Maguire. 7 Jannik Vestergaard Uneasy when England exposed lack of pace. Otherwise, a warrior who blocked numerous crosses and shots. 7 Jens Stryger Larsen Right wing-back had some joy as an attacking outlet but found life tough against Sterling. 6 Pierre-Emile Højbjerg Smart operator who enjoyed periods of dominance in an often frayed, frantic midfield before tiring. 7 Thomas Delaney Strong midfield runner who helped push England back. Covered every inch and was missed after going off. 7 Joakim Mæhle Billed as left-sided danger but was subdued by Walker throughout and outfoxed by Sterling for decisive spot-kick. 5 Martin Braithwaite Found pockets in front of defence but only threatened with late strike. Outfoxed Rice with smart piece of skill. 6 Mikkel Damsgaard Youngster’s stunning free-kick set England reeling. Lovely runner and constant, gliding threat until being replaced. 8 Kasper Dolberg Clever mover who tried to pull England’s defence around. Forced save from Pickford but flagged offside. 6 Substitutes Yussuf Poulsen (for Damsgaard, 67) Strapping forward did not offer enough presence to alleviate England pressure.

article108,Denmark end Wales’ Euro 2020 dreams as Dolberg double caps dominant win,2021-06-26 17:55:24,"['Euro 2020', 'Wales', 'Denmark', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","Twenty minutes after the final whistle, the pitch had long since emptied but the celebrations were still in their infancy and so, one by one, Denmark’s players zigzagged from the sidelines towards blocks of baying supporters, most of whom finished the game several rows further forward than where they started it. Joakim Mæhle freewheeled one way and then another clutching a red-and-white scarf, Kasper Dolberg followed, punching the air with both fists and then Kasper Schmeichel, the conductor of it all, surged across to rejoice. Where will this adventure end? On an Amsterdam evening when many locals turned out to offer their support to Christian Eriksen, another former Ajax prodigy propelled Denmark into the quarter-finals of the European Championship, 29 years to the day since they won the tournament. Dolberg scored twice, the first a delicious effort that nestled in the far corner, before Mæhle and Martin Braithwaite completed a resounding victory, flattening Wales’s hopes of matching their run to the semi-finals five years ago. After the third, Yussuf Poulsen, among the substitutes owing to injury, ripped off his snapback cap and bobbed besides his teammates, and when Braithwaite eluded Chris Mepham to drill in a fourth, confirmed following a VAR review for offside, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, was already proudly displaying the red home shirt previously hidden by a cream blazer. These were snapshots of another joyous occasion for a country that stood still for those agonising minutes in Copenhagen a fortnight ago. The scenes after Dolberg’s opener spoke to the togetherness that has acted as an umbrella over this Danish team and, in the stands, beer spilled down the terraces as fans allowed themselves to drink in a beautiful strike. The move started on halfway, when Mæhle fizzed a pass into the feet of Mikkel Damsgaard, whose display was bewitching and will only enhance the 20-year-old’s burgeoning profile. Damsgaard spiralled clear of Aaron Ramsey, prodded the ball into the path of Dolberg and the blond forward did the rest. He took the pass in his stride on his right foot, took a feathery touch, and then another to steady himself before sending a curling strike into the far corner. In truth, Wales were fortunate to go in at the interval trailing by just one goal. Moments after Dolberg’s opener, some slack defending presented Damsgaard with an inviting opportunity to dance in off the byline without any Welsh attention. Damsgaard drilled a teasing low cross into the six-yard box and Dolberg nonchalantly flicked the ball at goal with the outside of his left boot. The Wales goalkeeper, Danny Ward, not for the first time this tournament, made an instinctive right-handed save to keep his team in it. Wales’s game was as good as over as early as three minutes into the second half, when Dolberg seized on some excruciating defending to double Denmark’s advantage. Braithwaite, hugging the touchline, chested a lofted ball and then puffed out his chest before embarking on an incisive run. He stormed past Joe Rodon with little fuss before sliding a wonderful ball across the six-yard box. None of his Denmark team-mates could keep pace so the ball instead fell at the feet of the Wales substitute Neco Williams, amid seemingly little danger. But the full-back, on in place of Roberts, panicked and hacked a poor clearance straight to Dolberg, who gobbled up the chance. Denmark supporters have fallen back in love with their football team once more, stirred by the Eriksen’s tragic collapse at Parken, and how it showed. In the stands, fans with face paint, Viking horns and jester hats made sure they were heard and, before kick-off, a giant replica shirt bearing Eriksen’s name and No 10 was unfurled on the pitch to rapturous applause. The Wales Gareth Bale also presented his opposite number, Simon Kjaer, with a framed Eriksen Wales shirt that read “Brysia wella” – get well soon. The galling thing for Wales was that they started so brightly, with Bale particularly bubbly on the right flank. Bale was drifting into roomy pockets, trying his luck and seemingly in the groove. He sent a couple of shots wide, one that swerved dangerously past Schmeichel’s goal. But Wales lost their nerve after Dolberg’s strike and the game unravelled. First, Connor Roberts was forced off 40 minutes into his 64th appearance of a marathon season and then Kieffer Moore – one of five players walking a disciplinary tightrope – picked up a booking that would have ruled him out of a quarter-final. There was always only going to be enough room for one rousing tale to continue. “Guld for Eriksen,” were the words emblazoned on one Denmark flag draped over the top tier of this stadium and everywhere you looked there were banners with messages of support for the midfielder who called this place home for five years. The Denmark manager, Kasper Hjulmand, clasped Dolberg’s face with affection as the striker departed the pitch to a hero’s ovation but Wales were left with a horrible sense of what could have been."
article109,Raheem Sterling has been England’s spark and is the man Denmark should fear | Karen Carney,2021-07-06 06:15:20,"['Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'England', 'Denmark', 'Football', 'Sport']","Denmark’s defence, like all those England have come up against at the Euros, will be most wary of Raheem Sterling. The forward has been causing all manner of problems to help his country reach the semi-finals. Sterling came into the tournament with a few questions hanging over him after not featuring as much as he would have liked for Manchester City in the second half of the season. He has looked very hungry from the first whistle, motivated by his desire to further prove himself as a player for the big occasion. When someone doubts you, it drives you to better yourself because footballers need to challenge themselves constantly to get the best out of themselves. Everyone knows how good Sterling can be and it is fantastic to see him flourishing. In a team that has witnessed a lot of rotation during the tournament, Sterling and Harry Kane have been mainstays in the starting lineup. It is no surprise these two are selected regardless of the situation because Gareth Southgate has a lot of faith in them. Sterling knows the manager trusts him and that will give him confidence whenever he joins England. The change of scenery and atmosphere can be a great help for a player who may be frustrated – it can liberate them on the pitch and Sterling obviously feels at home within the England setup. In each game Sterling’s sharpness, speed and skill have brought a spark to the team. The upside to his not being an automatic selection at City is that he seems fresher than many players, which is not what an opposition defender wants. When Kane was not scoring in the group stage he was still providing for the team and Southgate did not need to worry in the knowledge Kane would come good at some point in the tournament and he had a firing Sterling who scored the goals sent England into the knockout stages. Anyone with Sterling’s speed is going to concern defenders but he uses it to maximum effect by running in behind, dribbling at people and getting in the positions to score. There is also the other side of his game many do not see: Sterling’s workrate has been incredible and he makes a lot of unselfish runs to drag defences around, often cutting inside to give space on the overlap, which has benefited the full-backs. Going the other way, Denmark attack a lot down their right and Sterling’s output could be crucial to stop them doing so: the best form of defence could be England’s attack on that side with Sterling. Denmark are most vulnerable down the flanks, which will work in his favour. Wales caused them problems in the early stages of their last-16 game thanks to fine wing play and Denmark had to change their shape to deal with it. Sterling’s speed, skill and movement will be key to get beyond the defence and drag England forward. Those who can dribble at defenders and beat men in one-on-one situations could decide the game, so Bukayo Saka would be a good option to return. I think Southgate will revert to the back three that featured against Germany and try to play on the front foot. The depth in the squad has helped take England this far, with players selected depending on the circumstance. It is generally the younger players who have come in to perform a specific role as part of Southgate’s meticulous plans. Saka and Jadon Sancho will have been more comfortable coming into a side with Sterling in form and Kane alongside them, alleviating some of the pressure. It is not just on the pitch where the senior players have helped youngsters settle; they have limited their exposure off it too. Sterling and Kane have tournament experience, whereas Saka, Mason Mount and Phil Foden are enjoying this adventure for the first time. There is a core group of leaders and they are stepping up to ensure the group stays focused on the task ahead. The older players know the pain of losing a semi-final despite putting in a lot of hard work and they will not want that feeling again. The team are still hurting from defeat by Croatia at the 2018 World Cup – you can hear it in their interviews. They have expectations of each other and themselves as they push towards the final. In women’s football we’ve been dominated heavily by the US, who can be intimidating due to their uber-confidence in their ability to win. This England group has the same attitude – there is a swagger that is good to hear and see and they are backing it up with their performances. They are not afraid to say: ‘We are in it to win it.’ We’re not used to hearing that from England and with Sterling leading the charge, we should have every confidence that they can."
article110,‘It’s all out now’: Robert Page backs Wales gameplan to derail Denmark,2021-06-25 17:44:12,"['Euro 2020', 'Wales', 'Denmark', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","Robert Page did not hesitate when asked whether he and his Wales team feel responsible for the nation as they attempt to knock Denmark out of Euro 2020 in the last-16 tie in Amsterdam on Saturday. “There’s no added pressure,” he said. “It’s another game of football for us – we’re fully prepared going into it. And we’ve got a gameplan that we think will go and hurt them. It’s not responsibility, it’s an absolute honour to be sat here representing Wales like this and the players feel exactly the same. “I’ll sleep OK tonight. The support we’ve had back home: as much as it is frustrating for everybody – staff, players and supporters – that the supporters can’t be out here, the messages we’ve had, and social media with the kids in school singing the anthem for us, which is a montage of clips that we’re going to put together and show the players; we know that everybody, come the kick-off, will be behind us.” Page noted that Denmark fans would vastly outnumber their Wales counterparts at the Johan Cruyff Arena because of a Netherlands government ban that would not apply if the UK were still in the EU. The Danes have a new constituency of followers across the globe after Christian Eriksen’s cardiac arrest in their opening group game with Finland. The game is being held at the home of Eriksen’s former club Ajax, where he played from 2010-13. Page was pitch perfect in addressing that backdrop. “First and foremost our priority is Christian and making sure he’s on the mend and making a full recovery and that’s all that matters in life,” he said. “The world has taken note of what happened and the emotion involved in it but we can’t get involved in that now. It’s work as usual for us. We have a job to do and we want to go out and finish it.” Gareth Bale, a four-times Champions League-winner with Real Madrid, Wales’s record scorer, captain and arguably greatest footballer, is relishing another massive game in the country’s history. His counsel to teammates, though, was to reach for an old adage. “We know the occasion that we’re in,” he said. “We’re in a big tournament. I think every game that we play, we feel is a big game. I think we just have to play the game tomorrow, not think of the occasion. And I’m sure we’ll be ready come kick-off for the game alone.” Bale was also the leader of Chris Coleman’s Euro 2016 vintage that went to the semi-finals. There is speculation that the 31-year-old, who claims a 96th cap versus Denmark, could make this tournament his swan song. The forward was asked whether he will play on Saturday as if for the last time for Wales. The question received a laugh and neat response. “No, I’m not going to play as if it’s my last because I want to get through to the next round,” Bale said. “[My] focus is on this game and not looking further.” He was more expansive when quizzed about his public persona, allowing a glimpse of a man who feels misunderstood and misrepresented by Real Madrid‑friendly Spanish media who serially portray him as more interested in golf than a club from which he has become estranged. “No one in the media knows who I am,” he said. “I like to keep it that way. I’m sure people have their perceptions, they read what people write, but I know who I am. I’m obviously not the person who people write about. I’m, I guess, a normal person that has a bit of a laugh with his friends. “So I’m not really bothered how people think of me. I am who I am, and I’m comfortable with that.” Pressed on what was the biggest misconception the shutters came down. “I honestly don’t care,” Bale said. “It’s not really about me, it’s about Wales and the game. I’m not bothered what people think of me. So it is what it is. All I’m worried about is trying to do my best for Wales, trying to get us through to the next round. I don’t need to say too much more than that.” For Page, Bale’s teammates and a nation dreaming of the adventure at these championships continuing to the quarter-finals and beyond, this is precisely what they want to hear. And given how Bale performed as he would wish during the group phase Kasper Hjulmand’s side will fear him most. Yet in Aaron Ramsey’s attacking play, Joe Allen’s midfield scheming and the pace of Dan James (who seems inspired by the Welsh jersey rather than cowed as he appears when in Manchester United’s), Page’s XI is potent beyond Bale’s menace. The team he sends out are expected to be the same that defeated Turkey because of Ethan Ampadu’s suspension, meaning a 4-2-3-1 with Kieffer Moore at the tip. Allen, Ben Davies, Chris Gunter, Chris Mepham and Moore are a booking from suspension but this is no time to be circumspect. As Page said: “The gloves are off. We are in the knockout stages, there is no managing bookings. We are fully ready for it. We are ready for a battle because it is going to be a battle. It’s all out now.”"
article111,Truss says Nord Stream gas pipeline damage ‘clearly sabotage’ ,2022-10-01 15:25:56,"['Liz Truss', 'Denmark', 'Europe', 'Politics', 'World news', 'Nord Stream 1 pipeline', 'Nord Stream 2 pipeline', 'Gas', 'Commodities', 'UK news', 'Energy industry']","Liz Truss has said a series of explosions that severely damaged Russia’s undersea Nord Stream gas pipelines were an act of sabotage. In a joint report delivered to the United Nations last week, the Danish and Swedish governments have claimed that the leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which can carry gas to Germany, were caused by blasts equivalent to the power of “several hundred kilograms of explosive”. The UK prime minister was updated on developments in the situation unfolding in the Baltic Sea as she engaged in talks with her Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, in Downing Street on Saturday. Suspicions have been rising in western capitals that the explosions on the pipelines were attacks carried out by Russia as a means of intensifying pressure in western governments over energy supplies. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has dismissed any such claims and said in a speech on Friday that “Anglo Saxons” were responsible. Calling the explosions a “terror attack”, Putin said the blasts were an attempt to “destroy the European energy infrastructure”. However, the US state department has called Putin’s comments “preposterous” and an act of “Russian disinformation”. Following the meeting between Truss and Frederiksen, a No 10 spokesperson said the leaders had stressed the importance of staying “united against Russia’s despicable action in Ukraine”. The spokesperson confirmed that the prime minister and her Danish counterpart had agreed that the incidents were “clearly an act of sabotage”, with Truss offering the UK’s support for the ongoing investigation. While neither leader sought to attribute responsibility for the incident, speaking to reporters outside No 10, Frederiksen said: “One of the reasons why I’m here today is because of the situation in the Baltic Sea, with Nord Stream 1 and 2. “I was able to give some details about what has happened in Denmark, or just outside Denmark. Of course, it has been very important for me to underline that the Danish authorities have said that this is not an accident. “This is sabotage and it is critical infrastructure. So of course, this is a very serious situation.” Neither of the Nord Stream pipelines is in operation although both still contain gas. Nord Stream 1 has not transported any gas since late August, when Russia closed it down for maintenance; Nord Stream 2 was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine in February."
article112,Denmark helped US spy on Angela Merkel and European allies – report,2021-05-31 14:34:14,"['Denmark', 'Angela Merkel', 'Europe', 'World news', 'NSA', 'US news', 'Espionage', 'Surveillance']","Reports that Denmark’s military intelligence agency helped the US to spy on leading European politicians, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have sparked concern – and demands for an explanation – in EU capitals. Danish public broadcaster Danmarks Radio said the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose alleged tapping of Merkel’s phone was disclosed by Edward Snowden in 2013, also used the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (FE) to spy on officials in Sweden, Norway and France. The allegations are contained in an internal classified report on the FE’s role in the surveillance partnership agreement with the NSA from 2012 to 2014, the broadcaster said, citing nine unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. It said the NSA used Danish information cables to spy on senior officials including the former German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the then opposition leader Peer Steinbrück. It was not clear whether the Danish government authorised the taps. The Danish defence minister, Trine Bramsen, who took over the defence portfolio in June 2019, was reportedly informed of the espionage in August last year. She told Danmarks Radio that “systematic eavesdropping of close allies” was “clearly unacceptable”. France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, said the reports were “extremely serious” if proven. “We need to see if our partners in the EU, the Danes, have committed errors in their cooperation with American services,” Beaune told French radio. “Between allies, there must be trust, a minimal cooperation.” Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday that the German government had “taken note of the reporting. It is in contact with all relevant national and international authorities for clarification.” Steinbrück said the NSA and FE’s activities were “a political scandal”. The former centre-left SPD party leader said he accepted western states needed intelligence services, but added it was “grotesque that friendly intelligence services are indeed intercepting and spying on top representatives of other countries”. Danmarks Radio published the allegations on Sunday evening in a joint investigation with the Swedish public broadcaster SVT, Norway’s NRK, France’s Le Monde, and Germany’s NDR, WDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung. The Danish broadcaster said the NSA retrieved text messages, calls and internet traffic including searches and chats thanks to its partnership with FE. Denmark, a close US ally, hosts several key landing stations for undersea internet cables to and from Sweden, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. Neither the agency or its director at the time, Lars Findsen, have commented on the report. Findsen and three other FE officials were suspended last year by an independent oversight board following criticism and accusations of serious wrongdoings stemming from the internal investigation, which began in 2015, Danmarks Radio said. The NSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sweden’s defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, demanded “full information” and his counterpart in Norway, Frank Bakke-Jensen, said the allegations “are being taken seriously”. If confirmed, the spying was happening during and after the 2013 Snowden affair, when the former NSA contractor revealed thousands of secret documents exposing the vast US surveillance operation mounted after the 2001 9/11 attacks. Snowden on Sunday accused Joe Biden, who was US vice-president at the time, of being “deeply involved … the first time around”. Snowden called on Twitter for “full public disclosure not only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well”. The former contractor has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence and is in Russia."
article113,‘This one is for you Christian’ – Denmark players celebrate Euro 2020 progress,2021-06-21 22:41:00,"['Denmark', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Euro 2020', 'European Championship']","The Danish players have dedicated their spectacular 4-1 win against Russia to Christian Eriksen. The midfielder is recovering at home after suffering a cardiac arrest in the opening game against Finland but was watching on TV as Denmark secured a place in the last 16 of Euro 2020 in front of a fanatical home crowd at Parken. The midfielder Christian Nørgaard said: “There is no doubt that this win was for Christian. We have gone through so much in the time we have been together and it was no doubt in our mind that this was not going to be the final chapter. That it all culminated like it did was written in the stars. We go into the next game with a huge feeling that we can win it.” The Barcelona forward Martin Braithwaite posted on Twitter: “What a night. This one is for you Christian Eriksen. Let’s go for more.” Denmark now face Wales in the last 16 in Amsterdam on Saturday. Mikkel Damsgaard gave them the lead against Russia with a beautiful shot from outside the area, with Yussuf Poulsen, Andreas Christensen and Joakim Mæhle scoring after the break. The coach, Kasper Hjulmand, could not stop smiling afterwards and said he and the team had been thinking about Eriksen “throughout this week”. He also praised the incredible support the team had got from the Danish fans in the stadium. “The Danes have looked after us this last week,” he said. “They have given us wings. Without all of you this would not have been possible. I had really been hoping that we were going to get a magical night today. It would have been so incredibly unfair if we hadn’t got something after this game. And I have to say that these players have played their way straight into the hearts of the Danes.” The Chelsea defender Christensen, who scored the third with a powerful long-range shot, said: “It is great to have reached the last 16. The only regret is that we won’t play that in Denmark. We are so grateful for the support we have had all week.”"
article114,Denmark tightens measures – as it happened,2021-01-05 23:42:47,"['Coronavirus', 'World news', 'UK news', 'US news']","We’ve launched a new blog at the link below – head there for the latest: Students in England will not be asked to sit GCSE and A-levels this summer, the Department for Education has said. Zimbabwe recorded 1,365 coronavirus cases and 34 deaths on Tuesday – its single biggest daily rise for both as it began a month-long lockdown to curb surging infections. Pupils in Northern Ireland will learn remotely until the half-term break, the executive has agreed, but it remains unclear whether A-level and GCSE exams will take place this summer. Chilean lawmakers are considering making vaccination against the coronavirus mandatory as the country’s centre-right government pushes to inoculate most of its population by mid-year. Israel’s cabinet has agreed to impose a “full lockdown” that will see current restrictions increased to shutter virtually the entire education system, including nurseries, and ban non-essential international travel, according to local media. People travelling to Ireland from any country will have to show a negative PCR test from the last 72 hours, the Irish Times reports. The UK has recorded a further 60,916 lab-confirmed cases – the highest daily total reported so far, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 2,774,479. Germany is extending its nationwide lockdown until the end of the month and is introducing new tougher restrictions in order to get control of surging coronavirus infections, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said. There is no indication that the coronavirus variant identified in South Africa is more transmissible than the one spreading fast in Britain, the World Health Organization’s technical chief on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, said. The head of the World Health Organization is “very disappointed” that China has still not authorised the entry of a team of international experts to examine the origins of the coronavirus. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is facing growing pressure over the schools fiasco and has been forced into a partial climbdown over this month’s vocational BTec exams. As Williamson prepared to face MPs in the Commons on Wednesday, college leaders and city mayors expressed disbelief that vocational and technical exams were going ahead despite a national lockdown and cancellation of all GCSEs and A-levels in the summer. YouTube has reinstated the page of talkRadio following “further review” by the video platform. The Google-owned site had initially suspended the radio station’s channel for what it said was a breach of its community guidelines, with reports suggesting it may have been linked to rules around Covid-19 misinformation. However, later on Tuesday YouTube said: “TalkRadio’s YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated.” A spokesperson added: “We quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines, including Covid-19 content that explicitly contradicts expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organisation. “We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case.” Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds has accused home secretary Priti Patel of leaving the “nation’s doors unlocked” to new coronavirus variants amid calls to increase border protections. Boris Johnson has said that ministers will be bringing in measures to ensure people arriving in the UK are tested but Labour and some senior Tory MPs have called for further action as England entered its third national lockdown. Thomas-Symonds wrote to Patel calling for an “urgent review and improvement plan” as he raised concerns over checks on arrivals who are meant to be quarantining. Mr Thomas-Symonds wrote: “It is especially worrying given the concerns regarding mutation of the virus that emerged in South Africa, which the health secretary rightly said is ‘incredibly worrying’. “However, the lack of a robust quarantine system as a result of shortcomings from the government mean that it is virtually impossible to keep a grip on this spread or other variants that may come from overseas, leaving the UK defenceless, and completely exposed, with the nation’s doors unlocked to further Covid mutations.” Chilean lawmakers are considering making vaccination against the coronavirus mandatory as the country’s centre-right government pushes to inoculate most of its population by mid-year. The bill presented to Congress would modify the country’s health code, which already requires vaccination against smallpox, whooping cough and other diseases, according to the opposition Christian Democracy party lawmakers who submitted the legislation. Chile was the first country in South America to begin a Covid-19 vaccination program. The country has deals with AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc/BioNTech and China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. “As we move forward in this process, we are unfortunately going to meet resistance from compatriots,” said bill sponsor Gabriel Silber. He said the bill would help ensure the effectiveness of the country’s ambitious vaccination program. An IPSOS survey in early December found that seven out of 10 Chileans said they would be willing to get vaccinated. Silber said the legislation would help assure Chile could effectively vaccinate 80% of its population, which health experts in the country say would be necessary to achieve herd immunity and stem virus transmission. Health minister Enrique Paris said earlier this week that officials would study the proposal. The Australian state of Victoria has reported one new locally acquired Covid-19 case, as return-to-work plans face scrutiny over the Black Rock cluster. Victoria recorded three new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, with just one coming from a local source and the other two acquired overseas. It takes the number of active cases in the state to 41. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc may take about two months to determine whether doses of the company’s Covid-19 vaccine can be halved to double the supply of the jabs in the US, according to the agency. The news comes as the country grapples with a surge in cases, with the number of vaccinations falling far short of early targets. The US government has been considering the move to halve the doses for Moderna’s vaccine, which requires two injections, to free up supply for more vaccinations. Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, the federal vaccine program, said on Sunday that officials were in talks with Moderna and the US Food and Drug Administration about the idea. The FDA said on Monday the idea of changing the authorised dosing or schedules of Covid-19 vaccines was premature and not supported by available data. Pupils in Northern Ireland will learn remotely until the half-term break, the executive has agreed, but it remains unclear whether A-level and GCSE exams will take place this summer. First Minister Arlene Foster said discussions on exams are ongoing with education secretary Gavin Williamson, with a decision to be made by Thursday. All educational establishments will move to online teaching until mid-February, including primary schools, post primary schools and nursery schools, Foster said. She added that the situation will be reviewed at the end of January. Childcare will be allowed to continue, even in an educational setting, Foster said, and childminders will be able to operate. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill outlined other restrictions, including: Stay-at-home advice is to be put into legislation from midnight on Thursday, with additional powers being given to the PSNI to enforce the measures. Household mixing will be reduced to just one other household or social bubble. In private homes and gardens, both indoor and outdoor gatherings will be restricted to members of one household, or a member of your support bubble. Outdoor and indoor gatherings will be restricted. The current position is that 15 people can meet outside that will be reduced to six people. The UK’s Covid-19 temporary register of nurses is being widened in an effort to bolster staff numbers as health and social care services face their “toughest challenge yet”. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) said it is hoped “as many overseas-trained nurses as possible” can opt to help the NHS as it copes in this “time of crisis”. The register established last year already includes includes thousands of former nurses who the NMC said stand ready to help. As part of an expansion announced on Tuesday, a little over 2,000 nurses who have trained overseas and are ready to take the final stage of their permanent registration application process will be invited to join the register. Andrea Sutcliffe, the NMC’s chief executive and registrar, said there is a “tremendous strain” on health staff due to rising infections and hospital admissions, alongside winter pressures and the vaccine rollout and that the need for “as many people as possible to provide skilled care and support in hospitals, nursing homes and in the community has never been greater”. She said “conditions of practice” will be applied to the temporary registration of both groups in the expansion “to ensure safe and supported practice”. Zimbabwe recorded 1,365 coronavirus cases and 34 deaths on Tuesday – its single biggest daily rise for both as it began a month-long lockdown to curb surging infections. The government announced an extended nationwide curfew, banned gatherings and ordered non-essential businesses to close for a month on Saturday. Health officials say the country’s hospitals are being overwhelmed as infections rise quicker than before. Zimbabwe has recorded a total of 14,084 cases and 418 deaths since the first infection was recorded last March. There was “a pretty high likelihood” that the new coronavirus variant 501.V2 identified in South Africa could be circulating locally, said Rashida Ferrand, a London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine professor working at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in the Zimbabwean capital Harare. But no sequencing had been done to investigate if there were cases of that variant in Zimbabwe yet, she said. Neighbouring South Africa is home to millions of Zimbabwean economic migrants and many locals frequently travel between the two countries on business and to visit family. “We have a much larger number of admissions currently compared to the first wave,” Ferrand told Reuters. Israel’s cabinet has agreed to impose a “full lockdown” that will see current restrictions increased to shutter virtually the entire education system, including nurseries, and ban non-essential international travel, according to local media. The lockdown will begin on Thursday night and last two weeks, as the daily number of virus cases surge past 8,000, with officials saying the “British mutation” was now spreading the country. At the beginning a cabinet meeting, which is still ongoing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: “We are in the midst of a global pandemic that is spreading at top speed with the British mutation. It has reached Israel and is claiming many lives.” “We need to impose a full lockdown immediately. We are in a Cabinet meeting and I have no doubt that the Cabinet will approve this and that the Knesset needs to pass it immediately,” he added, in reference to Israel’s parliament. Hebrew-language reports said special education classes will remain open. People travelling to Ireland from any country will have to show a negative PCR test from the last 72 hours, the Irish Times reports. It is understood that the travel ban from Britain will be lifted on Saturday, the same newspaper reports, but travellers will still have to present a negative PCR test. The ban on passengers from Britain and South Africa is being extended by 48 hours, it is understood. Students in England will not be asked to sit GCSE and A-levels this summer, the Department for Education has said. It said: “There is recognition that this is an anxious time for students who have been working hard towards their exams. “The government position is that we will not be asking students to sit GCSE and A-levels. Working alongside Ofqual, the department will consult on how to award all pupils a grade that reflects the hard work they’ve done and will continue to do.” Nigeria hopes to get 42m Covid-19 vaccine doses to cover one-fifth of its population through the global Covax scheme, the head of the country’s primary healthcare agency said as the West African country battles a second, larger spike in coronavirus cases. Faisal Shuaib said the batch of vaccines would come as part of Nigeria’s plan to inoculate 40% of the population this year, with another 30% in 2022. By the end of January, 100,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are expected to arrive, he said. The Covax scheme was set up to provide vaccines to poorer countries such as Nigeria, where 200 million people and poor infrastructure pose a daunting challenge to medical officials administering the vaccinations. Nigeria, where officials recorded low coronavirus numbers through much of 2020, had 1,204 new cases on Monday, its highest ever, as total confirmed cases edged closer to 100,000. Nigeria will first inoculate frontline health workers, first responders, national leaders, people vulnerable to coronavirus and the elderly, Shuaib said during a regular Covid-19 briefing in the capital Abuja. He also underscored popular resistance to vaccines and said Nigeria must educate people on their importance. “We fear what we don’t understand,” said Shuaib. The Grammy Awards ceremony that was set for 31 January has been postponed due to the coronavirus surge in Los Angeles, Rolling Stone magazine and Variety reported on Tuesday. The two outlets cited multiple sources as saying the ceremony, the highest awards in the music industry, may take place in March. The Recording Academy, which organises the Grammys, did not immediately return a request for comment. Boris Johnson said 1.3 million people across the UK have been vaccinated against Covid-19. More than 650,000 people over 80 – 23% of the cohort - have received their jab, he added. Johnson also pledged that 1,000 more vaccination stations would be open by the end of the week. People should get two doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine within 21-28 days, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday, as many countries struggled to administer the jabs that can ward off the Covid-19 virus. “We deliberated and came out with the following recommendation: two doses of this (Pfizer) vaccine within 21-28 days,” Alejandro Cravioto, chairman of WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), told an online news briefing. The panel said countries should have leeway to spread out shots over six weeks so that more people at higher risk of illness can get them. “Sage made a provision for countries in exceptional circumstances of (Pfizer) vaccine supply constraints to delay the administration of the second dose for a few weeks in order to maximise the number of individuals benefiting from a first dose,” Cravioto said. He added: “I think we have to be a bit open to these types of decisions which countries have to make according to their own epidemiological situations.” Sage executive Joachim Hombach said spacing out the two Pfizer inoculations could be acceptable for countries unable to implement the main recommendation. “The JCI, the recommending body of the UK, has given more flexibility up to 12 weeks in consideration of the specific circumstances that the country is currently facing,” he said. “We ... totally acknowledge that countries may see needs to be even more flexible in terms of administration of the second dose. But it is important to note that there is very little ... empirical data from the trials that underpin this type of recommendation,” he added. Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has said the government was aiming to vaccinate the country’s elderly by the end of March as he outlined plans to inoculate the country’s population. So far, the country has administered jabs to about 44,000 healthcare workers using Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, the only one available in the country so far, but authorities hope to ramp up vaccinations in coming weeks. Vaccinating all “senior citizens” by the end of March would be a huge logistical challenge in a nation of 127 million people with shoddy medical services in vast rural areas. “We are going to start at the bottom, where the most marginalised people live,” López Obrador told his daily morning news conference. Mexico expects to receive 1.4 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine that require two doses for each person by the end of January, which should be enough to vaccinate most of the 750,000 frontline healthcare workers who are at the front of the queue. López Obrador said the plan to vaccinate older adults in remote areas will rely on vaccines from Chinese company CanSino Biologics, in part because it requires a single shot and is easy to store. Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be kept in special ultra-cold freezers. Mexico has sought to order 35m CanSino vaccine doses, with about 8m arriving by March, officials say, though Mexico’s regulator has yet to approve its use. Mexico’s vaccination drive would be carried out in 10,000 community centres serving small and remote towns and focusing on adults above 60 years of age.

Slovaks in the country’s central Nitra region would not be allowed to work unless they have tested negative for coronavirus as the area’s main hospital was inundated with Covid patients and deaths were high, officials have said. The central European country of 5.5 million people has seen record numbers of new cases and hospitalisations in the past days, with 3,146 people in hospitals as of Monday, despite a partial national lockdown, Reuters reports. People from the Nitra region of about 160,000 would not be allowed to attend work as of Monday without a negative test, the prime minister, Igor Matovic, told a televised news conference from the central Slovak city. “The situation in Nitra is so dramatic that only voluntary testing would not be enough,” Matovic said. “This is a better way to protect workers, companies, the health of the people.” Belgium will receive only half the doses of the US drugmaker Pfizer’s vaccine it ordered for January because of a logistical difficulty that occurred last month. Spain could use the military to boost its vaccination effort as frustrations mount over the plodding pace of the campaign. Just under 83,000 doses of the vaccine have been given out since Spain kicked off its campaign about 10 days ago. The UK has recorded a further 60,916 lab-confirmed cases – the highest daily total reported so far, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 2,774,479. A further 830 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the UK total to 76,305. An estimated one in 50 people in private households in England had Covid-19 between 27 December and 2 January. England is in its third lockdown, the toughest since March. France reported 20,489 new confirmed Covid cases in the past 24 hours, up from 11,395 last Tuesday. It reported 867 new Covid deaths in hospitals and nursing homes. There were 378 hospital deaths on Monday. France is widening its Covid-19 vaccination rollout to firefighters and aid workers aged over 50 after making a slow start to its inoculation campaign. Italy reported 649 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday against 348 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 15,378 from 10,800. Germany is extending its nationwide lockdown until the end of the month and is introducing new tougher restrictions in order to get control of surging coronavirus infections, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said. There is no indication that the coronavirus variant identified in South Africa is more transmissible than the one spreading fast in Britain, the World Health Organization’s technical chief on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, said. The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency has told ambulance crews not to transport coronavirus patients who are unlikely to survive – in order to conserve oxygen supplies and ICU beds. The head of the World Health Organization is “very disappointed” that China has still not authorised the entry of a team of international experts to examine the origins of the coronavirus. Japan should issue a Covid-19 state of emergency in the Tokyo area as soon as possible, a panel of experts advising the government on coronavirus responses said. A study into patients with long Covid suggests many have been unable to return properly to work six months after infection. The research examined the impact on people months after their initial infection. The head of the World Health Organization is “very disappointed” that China has still not authorised the entry of a team of international experts to examine the origins of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. “Today we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team’s arrival in China,” the WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a news conference in Geneva. “I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials and I have once again made it clear the mission is a priority for the WHO,” he told reporters. Germany is extending lockdown measures until the end of the month and imposing new restrictions for coronavirus hotspots. Chancellor Angela Merkel and the premiers of Germany’s 16 federal states agreed on Tuesday afternoon to prolong by three weeks the lockdown that was put in place on 16 December. As part of the extension, social gatherings across Germany are to be limited to one visitor from outside each household, and staff and visitors entering care homes will in the future be required to carry out compulsory rapid tests beforehand. A new rule, restricting people’s movement to within 15 kilometers of their homes, will apply to municipalities that record more than 200 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within the space of a week. Over 70 municipalities, mostly in the eastern German states Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, currently record numbers high enough to trigger the new mechanism. Merkel said the aim of the lockdown was to get the rate of infections low enough to enable an efficient track-and-trace operation. This was particularly important with view to the new mutation first detected in Britain, Merkel said, which had created a “new and special situation”. Germany entered a “soft” lockdown at the start of November but decided to close nurseries, schools and non-essential shops before Christmas, in the face of rising fatalities linked to the virus. The Christmas lockdown, which was originally due to run out on 10 January, has not yet had a significant impact on the infection rates recorded by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s disease control agency. On Tuesday, the institute reported 11,897 new infections and 944 deaths in the last 24 hours. Merkel and the country’s state premiers will meet again on 25 January to decide on whether the lockdown will need to be extended again. There is no indication that the coronavirus variant identified in South Africa is more transmissible than the one spreading fast in Britain, the World Health Organization’s technical chief on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, said on Tuesday. France reported 20,489 new confirmed Covid cases in the past 24 hours, up from 11,395 last Tuesday. It reported 867 new Covid deaths in hospitals and nursing homes. There were 378 hospital deaths on Monday. In total, there are 24,904 people hospitalised with coronavirus, compared to 24,955 on Monday. Of those, 2,625 are in intensive care, compared to 2,666 on Monday. An estimated one in 50 people in private households in England had Covid-19 between 27 December and 2 January, the Office for National Statistics said. A dramatic surge in coronavirus cases has been reported in Greece, where the country’s public health organisation, EODY, said infections more than doubled today. A total of 928 people were diagnosed with the virus, up from the 427 yesterday. The spike was partly attributed to increased testing. A further 40 fatalities were also confirmed, bringing the death toll, which surpassed the grim milestone of 5,000 on Monday, to 5,051. Some 405 patients are intubated, said EODY, adding that the average age of those in intensive care is 68. On Sunday, health authorities confirmed the arrival in Greece of travellers carrying the new coronavirus variant, first spotted in the UK. By late Monday just under 10,000 citizens had been inoculated against the virus after the government’s roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine over the past week. Canada is on track to have well over a million coronavirus vaccine doses from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc by the end of January, the prime minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday. Trudeau, speaking to reporters, reiterated that Canada would have enough doses to vaccinate everyone who wanted an inoculation by the end of September. Canada has a population of about 38 million. The new coronavirus variant discovered in Britain could become a pandemic within a pandemic, Switzerland’s infection control chief said on Tuesday. Switzerland, where daily case numbers are at a high level, has found the mutation in 28 samples – all people who arrived from Britain, or people with whom they had been in contact, AFP reports. “This new variant could behave like a new pandemic within the pandemic,” Virginie Masserey, head of the health ministry’s infection control department, told journalists in the capital Bern. “That is to say it could spread exponentially and, indeed, add a new wave to the existing wave. “That’s why it is very important to really respect the measures that are recommended, to really reduce the number of infections.” The new variant has been found in seven of the 26 Swiss cantons, including Zurich, Geneva and Bern. “These mutant strains are now present in Switzerland and, according to scientific experts, they are much more infectious,” said Rudolf Hauri, president of the Association of Cantonal Doctors. “Given that in Switzerland, the activity or the spread of the virus has been far too high for several weeks ... we must absolutely try to delay the increased spread of this strain.” If the new variant could not be controlled, tighter restrictions would be necessary, said Masserey. The UK has recorded a new record for the number of coronavirus cases with a further 60,916 lab-confirmed cases as of 9am on Tuesday - the highest daily total reported so far. It brings the total number of cases in the UK to 2,774,479. The government said a further 830 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Tuesday, bringing the UK total to 76,305. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, together with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show there have now been 92,000 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England, said: “The rapid rise in cases is highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter. That is why if we can, we must stay at home, reduce contacts and do everything possible to break the spread of this virus. It is by no means easy, but now more than ever we must all do our part to protect the NHS and save lives. Turkey reported 14,494 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 2,270,101. It reported 194 related deaths over the same period, raising the total toll to 21,879. Ankara has imposed curfews each weekday evening and full weekend lockdowns for more than a month. The European Union is in talks with Pfizer and BioNTech over ordering up to 100 million more doses of their Covid-19 vaccine, Reuters reported three sources as saying. As European governments battle to speed up immunisations, the bloc, with a population of 450 million, has already ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and has taken up an option to buy another 100 million under a contract signed with the two companies in November. Each recipient needs two doses of the vaccine. The sources said the EU is seeking to buy 50 or 100 million additional doses from the companies. The EU agreed to pay 15.5 euros per dose in that contract, according to an EU document seen by Reuters. A European Commission spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday on numbers of possible orders. But on Monday he told a news conference the EU was trying to secure more doses from Pfizer and BioNTech in addition to the 300 million shots already booked A Pfizer spokesman said he could not comment as discussions with governments are confidential. BioNTech did not want to comment. Italy reported 649 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday against 348 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 15,378 from 10,800. Some 135,106 swab tests were carried out in the past day, the ministry said, against a previous 77,993. Italy has registered 76,329 Covid-19 deaths since its outbreak came to light on 21 February, the highest toll in Europe and the fifth highest in the world, Reuters reports. The country has also reported 2.182m cases to date, the health ministry said. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 stood at 23,395 on Tuesday, up 78 on the day before. There were 202 admissions to intensive care units, compared with 136 on Monday. The current number of intensive care patients fell by 10 to 2,569, reflecting those who died or were discharged after recovery. When Italy’s second wave of the epidemic was accelerating fast in the first half of November, hospital admissions were rising by about 1,000 a day, while intensive care occupancy was increasing by about 100 a day. The World Bank has called for rapid and decisive action to prevent a new debt crisis as it said the Covid-19 pandemic could result in a decade of disappointment for the global economy. In its half-yearly health check, the Washington-based institution said the pandemic had led to the sharpest annual increase in government debt in more than 30 years, and had exposed the vulnerability of many emerging market and developing countries. David Malpass, the Bank’s president, said the biggest slump in the global economy since the 1930s had widened the gap between rich and poor and there was a risk it could take years for people at the bottom to see a sustained improvement in their lives. Read more here: The Dutch government was caught off guard by the approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by EU regulators last month and has been unable to start vaccinating due to logistical problems, prime minister Mark Rutte told parliament today. The Netherlands has hundreds of thousands of Pfizer Covid vaccine doses in cold storage, but will not give a first shot until tomorrow, in a limited rollout to healthcare workers. Rutte’s government was criticised by MPs during a debate for allowing the Netherlands to be the last country in the EU to begin vaccinating. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on 21 December. By last week, 164,000 doses had been delivered to the Netherlands and that number stood at 288,000 on Tuesday, Rutte said. The Netherlands was not prepared for the logistics of distributing the Pfizer vaccine, which must be stored at -70C, Rutte told parliament. He said: The main problem was that we got it sooner than we had expected. It was a different vaccine (than we had expected) … making it impossible to be flexible. Labour party leader Lodewijk Asscher accused Rutte of making excuses, while “there are 300,000 vaccines in freezers and no one vaccinated”. The Dutch had planned to start vaccinating the most vulnerable people at elderly care homes, but the Pfizer vaccine comes in boxes of nearly 1,000 doses, which could not be stored at those sites. Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have remained high in recent weeks, despite a tough lockdown in which all schools and many stores were closed last month. “There are no convincing effects of the 15 December lockdown yet,” the National Institute for Public Health said today. Greek bishops’ determination to keep churches open for today’s Epiphany holiday in the face of a coronavirus lockdown have stepped up a confrontation with the government over health restrictions. Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis today urged the country’s Orthodox church to “assume its responsibilities” by closing places of worship. His appeal follows repeated criticism of the influential church of Greece over the clergy’s failures to respect health restrictions. Some have been seen not wearing masks, ignoring social distancing rules and even distributing communion. The government had until now called only for “individual responsibility” among worshippers. Yesterday, the Holy Synod council of top bishops said in a statement that it “would not consent to the measures imposed by the government” and planned to open churches for worship on Wednesday, the orthodox date for Epiphany. After a meeting with 82-year-old church head Archbishop Ieronymos, Mitsotakis’ office said in a statement today that he had insisted on “the need for all to strictly respect health measures” and called on the church to “set an example”. At least five senior clerics have been hit with the virus in the past month, one of whom died. Among them was Archbishop Ieronymos, the 82-year-old head of the Orthodox Church of Greece, who was hospitalised for two weeks. Some senior clergy have nevertheless said they could turn to the courts to overturn government measures. Limited numbers of faithful wearing masks were allowed to attend Christmas services in December despite a strict lockdown in force since early the previous month. But the government moved last week to close non-essential shops and places of worship for fear of a third coronavirus wave. More than 4,000 of Greece’s total 5,000 pandemic deaths have occurred in the past two months. Denmark has today imposed new lockdown measures aimed at curbing the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant that is believed to be more transmissible, the country’s prime minister said. Denmark imposed a hard lockdown in December, including closing bars, restaurants and other non-essential shops, to curb a worrying spike in new infections, which has pushed the country’s hospitals to the brim of their capacity. In recent days, some MPs have called for a tightening of restrictions over fears of a new variant of the coronavirus, first detected in Britain, which is thought to be more transmissible than others. Prime minister Mette Frederiksen told a news conference: The mutation is already so widespread that it cannot be stopped. But we can delay it and drag out the time so we can vaccinate more people. Health authorities said they expect the new virus variant to be the dominating one in Denmark by the middle of next month. The new restrictions include lowering the limit on public gatherings to five people from 10 previously, while a 2-metre distancing rule will be introduced in public areas, including in retail shops. Germany is set to restrict non-essential travel to a 15-kilometre (9.3-mile) radius in coronavirus hot spots in a bid to curb the spread of the pandemic, sources have told Reuters. The rule would apply to towns and counties that have recorded more than 200 new cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the sources added. This would be the first nationwide rule in Germany restricting movement for those in hard-hit regions. Chancellor Angela Merkel and the heads of Germany’s 16 federal states are discussing an extension to a lockdown that is currently due to run out on 10 January. Merkel is due to hold a news conference later today. Japan will decide this week whether to impose a state of emergency in the Tokyo area, a top official said on Tuesday as daily Covid-19 infections hit a record. The government’s top spokesman, chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato said a decision would probably come on Thursday, after local media said a state of emergency, the second since the pandemic began, would take effect by Friday and last about a month. A panel of experts advising prime minister Yoshihide Suga later recommended that restrictions to curb a surge in cases be imposed as soon as possible. “There is a risk of nationwide and rapid spread of infections taking place if the infection situation in Tokyo and surrounding regions does not subside,” Shigeru Omi, head of the panel, told a news conference, Reuters reports. New cases in Tokyo surged to 1,278 on Tuesday, the second highest daily total since the pandemic began, with the national daily tally reaching a record 4,670, public broadcaster NHK reported. Vietnam has suspended inbound flights from countries with new Covid-19 variants, initially Britain and South Africa, the health ministry. A new variant first found in Britain includes a genetic mutation that could result in the virus spreading more easily between people. “The risk for the disease to penetrate and spread in Vietnam is very high, especially from people entering from infected countries,” the ministry said in a statement. Reuters reports that prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has told authorities to work on a list of other countries that should be covered by the suspension, the ministry said, adding that he has ordered them to tighten control of quarantine facilities. Vietnam has suspended all inbound international commercial flights since late March, but the government has been operating repatriation flights to bring home Vietnamese citizens stuck abroad amid the pandemic. Some special flights carrying foreign experts and investors have been allowed to fly into Vietnam. All people entering the country have to spend 14 days in quarantine. Vietnam on Tuesday reported seven imported Covid-19 cases, raising the total number of infections in the country to 1,504, with 35 deaths. Stung by criticism that France has been dangerously slow to begin vaccinating the population, Olivier Véran, the health minister, said on Tuesday that France will catch up with neighbouring countries in “the next few days”. Véran said sapeurs pompiers (firefighters and first responders) and home helps aged over 50 would now be getting the vaccine. The programme started nine days ago with elderly residents of nursing and care homes, but has been slowed by the health authorities insistence that those being vaccinated must have a medical appointment, be given time to consider if they want it and give written consent. Véran added that the elderly in the larger community – those over the age of 75 – will start getting the vaccine at the end of January when the country should have opened several hundred dedicated vaccination centres. Véran promised to “widen, accelerate and simplify” the vaccine programme. On Tuesday, prime minister Jean Castex, visiting the south of France, also criticised the attack on the government over the slow progress of vaccinations saying it was a “sterile argument … that never saved a single life”. “The row helps nobody and brings no solution,” Castex said. The website CovidTracker suggested 2,000 people had been vaccinated in France, but said the figure for Monday was an estimate and it was waiting for official figures from the Health Ministry. These were due to be published on Tuesday morning, but by Tuesday afternoon the site still had not been updated. To reach the government’s stated target of inoculated 1 million people by the end of January, CovidTracker suggested 36,963 people would need to be vaccinated every day until the end of the month. Belgium will receive only half the doses of US drugmaker Pfizer vaccine it ordered for January because of a logistical difficulty that occurred last month. Spain could use military to boost vaccination effort as frustrations mount over the plodding pace of the campaign.Just shy of 83,000 doses of the vaccine have been given out since Spain kicked off its campaign some 10 days ago. The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency has told ambulance crews not to transport coronavirus patients who are unlikely to survive – in order to conserve oxygen supplies and ICU beds. England has entered its toughest nationwide lockdown since March, with schools closed and people allowed to leave home once a day for exercise for at least six weeks, prime minister Boris Johnson has announced as the numbers of people in hospital reach new highs. Japan should issue a Covid-19 state of emergency in the Tokyo area as soon as possible, a panel of experts advising the government on coronavirus responses said. German chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders are expected to extend a shutdown in Europe’s top economy as coronavirus deaths continue to mount despite tough restrictions in the run-up to the holidays. France is widening its Covid-19 vaccination rollout to firefighters and aid workers aged over 50 after making a slow start to its inoculation campaign, The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, discussed the possibility of jointly producing coronavirus vaccines in a phone call, the Kremlin said today. Italy has decided to keep nationwide restrictions in place while relaxing curbs on weekdays, A study into patients with long Covid suggests many have been unable to return properly to work six months after infection.The research examined the impact on people months after their initial infection. Spain’s minister of defence has suggested the military could be used to bolster the country’s vaccination efforts, as frustrations mount over the plodding pace of the campaign. Just shy of 83,000 doses of the vaccine have been given out since Spain kicked off its campaign 10 days ago. “At this rate it could take us five years to vaccinate against Covid-19,” public health nurse Antonio Forcada told Spanish newspaper El Mundo. Spain is among the European countries hardest hit by the virus, with more than 50,000 deaths and close to 2m confirmed cases. The vaccine rollout has varied wildly between regions; Madrid said on Saturday it had used 6% of the vaccination doses it had received while the northern region of Asturias said Monday that it had delivered 81%. As reports linked the slow pace of the campaign to staffing issues, Spain’s defence minister said the military would be willing to help if needed. “They are fully available for whatever the health authorities ask of us,” Margarita Robles told reporters on Tuesday. “We have the logistics.” Throughout the pandemic, Spain’s military has been brought in to help with tasks that range from disinfecting care homes to contact tracing. In Madrid, where health care workers have long pleaded for an injection of resources in the overburdened public health care system, the conservative regional government hinted it would instead lean on the private sector for help with vaccination. “In a pandemic situation, one should use all resources as needed, whether public or private,” Madrid’s deputy health chief, Antonio Zapatero, told broadcaster RTVE. Soon after it emerged that the Madrid regional government had signed a six-month, €800,000 contract with the Spanish Red Cross to provide 25 staff to help with vaccination – making Madrid the first region in Spain to subcontract vaccinations, according to news website ElDiario.es. Japan should issue a Covid-19 state of emergency in the Tokyo area as soon as possible, a panel of experts advising the government on coronavirus responses said on Tuesday. Chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato said earlier in the day the government was working toward deciding on Thursday whether to impose such an order in and around the capital. Sweden has registered 32,369 new coronavirus cases since its latest update on 30 December, health agency statistics showed on Tuesday. Sweden registered 258 new deaths, taking the total to 8,985. The deaths registered have typically occurred over several days and sometimes weeks. The health agency has said statistics over the Christmas period are less reliable than usual because fewer tests are carried out and due to delays in reporting of deaths. Sweden’s death rate per capita is several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than several other European countries that opted for lockdowns, Reuters reports. Oman has registered its first case of the highly contagious coronavirus variant that emerged in Britain, in a resident who arrived from the UK, the health ministry said on Tuesday. The resident developed respiratory symptoms in quarantine, despite testing negative before travelling, the ministry said in a statement carried on Oman’s state news agency. A study into patients with long Covid suggests many have been unable to return properly to work six months after infection. The research examined the impact on people months after their initial infection. While some seemingly return to normal health, others are left with debilitating fatigue and so-called “brain fog” among other symptoms. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, examined symptoms as well as other factors, PA Media reports. Researchers from Patient-Led Research for Covid-19 conducted a survey of more than 3,700 long Covid patients from 56 different countries. Most (96%) reported that their symptoms lasted more than 90 days. The paper, published as a pre-print on MedRxiv, found that symptoms affected 10 different “organ systems”. The most frequent symptoms reported after six months were fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and post-exertional malaise - the worsening of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion. As parts of the UK enter a third Covid lockdown, how does rest of Europe compare? Jon Henley examines the rules from country to country. There have been a further 2,069 cases of coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 159,278. Public Health Wales reported another 17 deaths, taking the total in Wales since the start of the pandemic to 3,662. Abu Dhabi has set out a list of exemptions for those vaccinated against Covid-19 to encourage take-up. Benefits would include fewer tests to removing the need to quarantine after returning from abroad, according to The National. Rwanda has banned transport in and out of the capital, Kigali, and extended an evening curfew for a further 15 days amid a deadly second wave of coronavirus. Rwanda, which in March last year was one of the first countries in Africa to impose strict lockdowns, has registered 105 deaths from Covid, half of them recorded in December alone. On Monday evening, the prime minister’s office released a statement ordering the new measures, effective from Tuesday, AFP reports. All public and private transport in and out of Kigali, and between different districts has been banned. An 8pm-4am curfew has been extended and all businesses ordered to close at 6pm. The UK government has announced that about 600,000 retail, hospitality and leisure sites will be able to claim a one-off grant of up to £9,000 ($12,200). The payments will cost the treasury £4.6bn ($6.24bn) and are aimed to help support the high street as new lockdown measures announced in Britain on Monday take hold. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also announced a further £594m ($807m) for local authorities and devolved administrations to support businesses not eligible for the grants. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has told the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, that he will have to cancel his scheduled visit to India this month to focus on the coronavirus response, Downing Street said. A No 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister spoke to prime minister Modi this morning, to express his regret that he will be unable to visit India later this month as planned. In light of the national lockdown announced last night, and the speed at which the new coronavirus variant is spreading, the prime minister said that it was important for him to remain in the UK so he can focus on the domestic response to the virus. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, discussed the possibility of jointly producing coronavirus vaccines in a phone call, the Kremlin said today. “Issues of cooperation in combating the coronavirus pandemic were discussed with an emphasis on the possible prospects for joint production of vaccines,” the Kremlin said in a statement. The Kremlin added that an agreement was reached to “continue contacts on the issue” between the two countries’ health ministries and specialised agencies, AFP reports. Both Russia and Germany have recently started mass vaccination drives at home to curb the spread of the coronavirus and avoid reimposing nationwide lockdowns. While Germany is using the vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Russia has put into mass circulation its homemade jab – Sputnik V. Ministers are considering introducing a requirement for international arrivals to have a negative coronavirus test before travelling to Britain to tackle surging cases, PA Media reports. The plans, which would include hauliers being exempt, were being discussed as prime minister Boris Johnson imposed the third national lockdown in England to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed. Johnson has faced calls to strengthen border protections to prevent the arrival of new cases, particularly of new and concerning strains. A Department for Transport spokesman said: “Protecting public health in the UK is of the utmost importance and we are looking at what additional measures could be taken with regards to international travel.” Currently arrivals into England from nations that are not exempted under the travel corridor programme have to isolate for 10 days. But under the test and release scheme introduced in December, this can be shortened if they have a private test five days after their arrival and it comes back negative. Belgium will receive only half the doses of US drugmaker Pfizer vaccine it ordered for January because of a logistical difficulty that occurred last month, Reuters reports. Health ministry spokesman Yves Van Laethem said a logistical issue in the second half of December prevented the delivery of the vaccines as planned in the Belgian vaccination strategy, without detailing the problem. “The company Pfizer, which supplies us, will only be able to supply half of the planned doses for the month of January and so we go from 600,000 doses to a little over 300,000 doses,” Van Laethem told a news conference. After vaccinating about 700 people in four nursing homes during a test week of vaccination, Belgium started on Tuesday to vaccinate residents in nursing homes nationwide along with the health staff there. The country of 11 million people has suffered one of Europe’s highest death rates per capita from the pandemic, with 60% of fatalities occurring in nursing homes. This first phase of vaccination will continue as planned with two doses being injected. “It was decided to continue a complete vaccination with two doses in the most fragile people, struck more heavily by the disease,” Van Laethem said. Spain, which is heavily dependent on tourism, saw the number of registered jobless jump by nearly 23% in 2020, government figures show. By the year’s end, the number of people out of work had risen by 724,532 from the figure a year earlier to 3,888,137, labour ministry data showed. In December alone, an extra 36,825 people registered as unemployed. By the end of 2020, the number of people still on furlough stood at 755,000, AFP reports. “We are ending a dreadful year for employment,” said Lorenzo Amor, deputy head of the Spanish Confederation of Employers’ Organisations (CEOE), who called on the government to extend its ERTE furlough scheme, which has already been renewed twice. Union bosses say the furlough scheme has been vital, with Unai Sordo, secretary general of the Workers’ Commissions (CCOO) admitting without it and other safeguards, there “could have been another 2 million unemployed”. Spain is expected to show the biggest slump among western economies this year, with the IMF expecting growth to contract by 12.8%. In Ireland, the number of people claiming temporary coronavirus-related jobless benefits has jumped sharply as infection levels exceed those seen than during the first wave in April and May, Reuters reports. Some 335,600 people will receive the pandemic unemployment payment this week, data showed on Tuesday. The number receiving the payment in the week before Christmas was 277,700. The Irish government said on 30 December it would maintain the payment at the current rate at least until the end of March after announcing the closure of non-essential retail to help curb a surge in infections. Hungary’s government is lifting a ban on passenger flights from Britain with effect from Wednesday, the government’s coronavirus taskforce told an online briefing on Tuesday. The government imposed the ban on 22 December to limit the spread of a more contagious variant of the virus that emerged in Britain. The ban was originally due to last until 8 February. Hi. Caroline Davies here, taking over the blog for the next few hours. You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com Arrangements being made to vaccinate hajj pilgrims, according to the Times of India. Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvihas said the last date for submission of application forms for Haj 2021 is 10 January. About 4,200 women have applied for Haj 2021. The number of embarkation points have been reduced to 10. Iran has registered the first case of the new coronavirus variant in a traveller who has arrived from the UK, Reuters is reporting. A political row has erupted in India over the home-grown coronavirus vaccine, according to the South China Morning Post. The Covaxin vaccine was granted emergency approval before final-stage human trials had been completed. Health experts have widely criticised the move as premature, pointing out that there is no publicly available data on its efficacy. Squabbles between politicians from the BJP and other parties added to the simmering unrest among the Muslim and Hindu communities over the vaccine’s alleged contents. The All India Drug Network, a health watchdog, said in a statement that it was “shocked to learn of the recommendation” without phase-3 efficacy data or proof that it worked against mutant strains. “Anybody would tell you that this is bad vaccine development science,” co-convenor Malini Aisola said. Some slightly cheering news from Germany, where retail sales rose in November and jobless numbers fell last month, against forecasts that both readings would worsen. The figures suggest that parts of Europe’s largest economy have weathered the impact of the coronavirus unexpectedly well, Reuters is reporting. Retail sales rose 1.9% in November, when markets had anticipated a contraction, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday, adding that it expected sales to have grown about 4% during 2020 as a whole – exceeding 2019’s 3.2% expansion. The monthly increase – covering a period when Germany was in partial lockdown with shops still open – was driven by online transactions and spending on home improvements. In separate – less cheering – data, the Federal Labour Agency said the number of jobless fell a seasonally adjusted 37,000 year on year in December, when the lockdown was tightened, with most shops forced to close from mid-month. Analysts had expected an increase. ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said use of a state-backed part-time work scheme designed to protect jobs meant that the figures should be taken “not only with a pinch but a big spoon of salt”. Some 666,000 people were placed on the scheme in December. Daily coronavirus cases in Japan reached a record 4,670 on Tuesday, the country’s commercial broadcaster NTV reported. The Japanese government is considering declaring a state of emergency in and around Tokyo as coronavirus cases climb. The Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet is reporting that the country is facing tighter coronavirus measures after a government meeting due for 11.30am local time. Sources have told the newspaper that the 10-person limit on gatherings is likely to be lowered – possibly to five people. France is widening its Covid-19 vaccination rollout to firefighters and aid workers aged over 50 after making a slow start to its inoculation campaign, health minister Olivier Véran said on Tuesday. “We are going to amplify, accelerate and simplify our vaccination strategy,” Véran told RTL radio, adding that 300 vaccination centres would be operational from next week. Reuters is reporting that France has accelerated its Covid-19 vaccination of medical staff in hospitals after being criticised for a slow start in one of the most vaccine-sceptical countries in the world. France delivered only 516 Covid-19 inoculations during the first week of a campaign that focused on nursing home residents. The sluggish start compared with European neighbours such as Britain and Germany has irritated President Emmanuel Macron, who met with his prime minister and health minister on Monday evening to discuss how to speed up deployment of the vaccine. Veran also told RTL that by the end of January France would authorise the vaccination of people aged 75 and above who are living at home. France’s total number of cases stands at 2,659,750, the fifth-highest in the world. The country’s Covid-19 death toll is at 65,415, the seventh-highest in the world. Italy has decided to keep nationwide restrictions in place while relaxing curbs on weekdays, Reuters is reporting. Italians spent much of Christmas and new year at home, with people allowed to leave their houses only for work, health and emergencies, or for brief trips to see a limited number of friends or relatives. These rules are set to expire on Thursday and ministers agreed at a late Monday night cabinet meeting to return to the old, three-tier system, which allows for different measures to be applied to different regions. All bars and restaurants across the country will have to close this weekend, with travel between towns and cities kept to a minimum. The government has also decided to postpone the Thursday reopening of high schools to 50% of their capacity until Monday. Some regions, including northern Veneto, around Venice, have decided to delay the reopening until 31 January. The number of daily cases has fallen from a high of about 40,000 in mid-November to well under 20,000 at present. But the infection rate has vacillated, with many hundreds dying each day. Russia has reported 24,246 new coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours, including 4,842 in Moscow, taking the national tally to 3,284,384. Authorities said 518 people had died, taking Russia’s official death toll to 59,506. Yesterday, the country reported 23,351 new cases and 482 deaths. International tourist arrivals to Spain fell 90% year-on-year in November, official data shows, after authorities imposed new travel restrictions to curb an increase in coronavirus infections. Over the first 11 months of the year, 19 million foreign tourists visited Spain, about 78% fewer than in the same period of 2019, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said. Tourists spent 91% less in November than in the same month a year ago, INE said. Public hospitals in Hong Kong could begin testing day patients for Covid-19 as city faces more than 30 new cases, the South China Morning Post is reporting. The potential tightening of screening measures follows the emergence of a cluster in the medical day ward of Princess Margaret Hospital in Kwai Chung. Likely candidates for the new screenings being patients believed at high risk, as well as health care providers working in intensive care units. To date, the city has recorded 9,017 confirmed infections and 153 related deaths. More than 30 people had tested preliminary-positive for the coronavirus on Monday. Five people, including three patients, a doctor and a nurse, have been infected. A mandatory testing order was also issued to all visitors to the ward between 28 December and Sunday. Britain will shortly publish plans for new border restrictions to limit the spread of Covid-19, cabinet office minister Michael Gove has said. “We’ll be coming forward very shortly with new proposals on how exactly we will make sure that our borders are safe,” Gove told Sky News. “But the message is very, very clear for UK citizens that they should not be travelling.” Gove also promised more support for businesses, with announcements expected later today. As a team from the World Health Organization (WHO) prepares to visit China to investigate the origins of Covid-19, Reuters is reporting how Beijing has stepped up efforts not only to prevent new outbreaks, but also shape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began. China has dismissed criticism of its early handling of the coronavirus, first identified in the city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, and foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said yesterday that the country would welcome the WHO team. But amid simmering geopolitical tensions, experts said the investigators were unlikely to be allowed to scrutinise some of the more sensitive aspects of the outbreak, with Beijing desperate to avoid blame for a virus that has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide. “Even before this investigation, top officials from both sides have been very polarised in their opinions on the origins of the outbreak,” said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, a US thinktank. “They will have to be politically savvy and draw conclusions that are acceptable to all the major parties,” he added. While other countries continue to struggle with infection surges, China has aggressively doused flare-ups. After a new cluster of cases last week, the city of Shenyang sealed off entire communities and required all non-essential workers to stay home. Taiwan has reported two new imported Covid cases after a Taiwanese woman who had received three negative tests for Covid in the US, tested positive upon arrival in Taiwan. The Taiwan News is reporting that the total number of officially confirmed cases in Taiwan is now 817. This latest case concerns a Taiwanese woman in a 20s who lives in the US. In early December, she suffered a runny nose and nasal congestion. She took coronavirus tests on 15, 26 and 29 December but they all came back negative. On 2 January, she “noticed an abnormality with her sense of smell”, according to the newspaper. She reported the symptom when she arrived in Taiwan with a family member on 3 January and was tested at the airport. On 5 January, she was diagnosed with the virus. The health department has identified a total of eight contacts in her case, including seven passengers who sat near her and her relative. All eight have been told to undergo home isolation. Since the outbreak began, Taiwan has carried out 128,798 Covid-19 tests, with 126,355 coming back negative. Out of the 817 officially confirmed cases, 722 were imported, 56 were local, 36 came from the navy’s “Goodwill Fleet”, two were from the cargo pilot cluster, one is an unresolved case, and one (case number 530) was removed as a confirmed case. Up until now, seven people have died of the disease in Taiwan, while 697 have been released from hospital isolation, leaving 113 patients still undergoing treatment in Taiwan. The Guardian view on Boris Johnson – forever behind the Covid curve: Last March, as the public clamour for stricter measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 became impossible to ignore, the government fretted over the country’s willingness to sign up to a national lockdown. As it turned out, most people were far more hawkish than the government in supporting draconian restrictions on everyday life. By waiting until late in the month, crucial ground was lost and so, unnecessarily, were thousands of lives. And it’s good morning from me, Amelia Hill, here in old London town, ready to steer you through the next few hours of global coronovirus news. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan. Here is a short piece about the nature of narwhals. Vikings believed they could cure melancholia – and so do I: If there is an animal, plant, insect or other natural thing you think I should cover in this new column, let me know on Twitter: Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency has told ambulance crews not to transport coronavirus patients who are unlikely to survive – in order to conserve oxygen supplies and ICU beds. England has entered its toughest nationwide lockdown since March, with schools closed and people allowed to leave home once a day for exercise for at least six weeks, prime minister Boris Johnson has announced as the numbers of people in hospital reach new highs. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said his state has found its first case of the more contagious strain of the coronavirus first detected in the UK, raising concerns about threats to hospital capacity should it spread rapidly. Airlines to back approval for global travel testing programme – reports. A group representing major US airlines on Monday backed a proposal by public health officials to implement a global testing programme requiring negative tests before most international air passengers return to the US, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Mexico approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for emergency use Monday, hoping to spur a halting vaccination effort that has only given about 44,000 shots since the third week of December, about 82% of the doses the country has received, AP reports. Japan’s top-ranked sumo wrestler Hakuho has tested positive for coronavirus, the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) announced on Tuesday. Mongolian-born Hakuho, who is the longest-serving yokozuna – top-ranked sumo wrestler – of all time announced via the JSA website that he took a Covid-19 test after losing his sense of smell. Germany to prolong shutdown as virus deaths surge. German chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders are expected Tuesday to extend a shutdown in Europe’s top economy as coronavirus deaths continue to mount despite tough restrictions in the run-up to the holidays. As weeks have turned to months, and months roll into a year, the shadow cast by Covid-19 continues to lengthen – not least for many of those who have survived the disease. Earlier this year, some of those who caught the virus early in the pandemic told the Guardian about their ongoing symptoms, from breathlessness and fatigue to mental health problems and “brain fog”. The testimonies were stark. Among them, Alice* talked of waves of symptoms that she described as being like “a storm”, while Jenny* was left with exhaustion and wrist pain months after infection. For Mirabai Nicholson-McKellar, the ongoing cognitive impairment that came with Covid was “completely crippling”, while Julie experienced hallucinations. Several months on, we caught up with them to explore just how long “long Covid” can be: When Unilever said in November it would move staff in its New Zealand office to a four-day week on the same pay, the maker of Dove soap and Magnum ice-cream which employs more than 150,000 people worldwide, gave the kind of high-profile endorsement for flexible working that campaigners have been waiting for. With productivity increases close to zero since the 2008 financial crash and the pandemic forcing companies like Target to rethink how they deploy their resources, there is a growing expectation that a broader shift to shorter working hours will happen in 2021. A recent report by the thinktank Autonomy argued that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, could prevent a steep rise in unemployment if he supported companies moving to a four-day week. It said a majority of 50,000 firms studied would be able to cope with the change through higher productivity or by raising prices. It urged the government to investigate ways of rolling out a four-day week, starting with the public sector: The Thai government is debating whether to impose a national lockdown, Veena Thoopkrajae reports for the Guardian. The Thai Chamber of Commerce has estimated the new wave of pandemic would cost Thailand between 1.5 billion and 2 billion baht (US$66m)per day if the Covid-19 is not brought under control within a month. The Prime Minister has so far asked Thai people to adhere to a voluntary lockdown by staying at home, while private businesses have been asked to promote working from home. Thailand recorded 527 new cases on Tuesday, all but six of them local transmissions. Total case in the country recorded at 8,966. No new deaths were reported, leaving the accumulated death toll at 65. Singapore has announced its police will be able to use data obtained by its coronavirus contact-tracing technology for criminal investigations, a decision likely to increase privacy concerns around the system. The technology, deployed as both a phone app and a physical device, is being used by nearly 80% of the 5.7 million population, authorities said, after announcing its use would become compulsory in places such as shopping malls. The TraceTogether scheme, one of the most widely used in any country, has raised privacy fears but authorities have said the data is encrypted, stored locally and tapped by authorities only if individuals test positive for Covid-19: Milan’s mayor, Beppe Sala, admits he made mistakes. In late February 2019, a week after the first locally transmitted coronavirus case was confirmed in Italy, he shared a promotional video on his Facebook page with the slogan “Milan does not stop”. The clip contained images of people hugging, eating in restaurants, walking in parks and waiting at train stations. It was not Sala’s finest hour. The city was not under lockdown at the time but it had quickly come to a standstill as tourists fled and commuters began working from home. Sala was not alone in his assessment of the risk of the virus and several scientists and politicians were giving mixed messages, but by the time the wider Lombardyregion went into lockdown on 8 March, he was rigorously urging citizens to stay at home. He says he has learned from his experiences: Coronavirus has plunged Britain’s summer music festivals into “existential crisis”, the umbrella organisation for the UK music industry warned on Tuesday and called for greater government support. AFP: In a report, UK Music said Covid-19 had caused an “existential crisis for the live sector and UK music festivals” and that the 2020 season had been “wiped out” by the virus. “There is a real threat that the vast majority of the 2021 season will not happen either,” the organisation said. In July, the music sector was given a lifeline of £250 million from the government’s £1.6-billion Cultural Recovery Fund to help keep the arts afloat during the outbreak. UK Music is now calling on authorities to give an approximate date for when venues might be able to reopen and for the creation of a government-backed reinsurance scheme for the sector. UK Music’s chief executive, Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, said it was “in the national interest for the sector to be supported and helped back to normal”. “If the right support and reassurance is not put in place for event organisers, artists and venues now, then there is a serious risk that much of the summer live music season will be cancelled,” he said. Tokyo’s annual New Year tuna auction ended Tuesday without the usual jaw-dropping bidding war, with the country’s “Tuna King” holding back on gunning for the top fish, citing the pandemic woes affecting the restaurant industry, AFP reports. The most expensive fish of the day - a 208-kilogram (459-pound) bluefin caught off the northern Aomori region of Japan, known for its quality tuna - was bought by another bidder for 20.84 million yen ($202,000). That is just a fraction of the millions of dollars that sushi businessman and self-proclaimed “Tuna King” Kiyoshi Kimura has shelled out in recent years to secure the bragging rights that come with buying the auction’s top tuna. Last year, Kimura paid $1.8 million for a 276-kilogram (608-pound) bluefin, and in 2019 he paid a record $3.1 million for a 278-kilogram (613-pound) fish. Normally, after winning the annual bidding war and taking his expensive investment back to one of his restaurants, he fillets the fish with a sword-like blade, creates sushi out of it and serves it to customers at no extra charge, all in front of an army of television cameras. The most expensive tuna this year was acquired jointly by a famous wholesaler named Yukitaka Yamaguchi, a frequent guest on television shows who supplies top sushi restaurants, and a major food business, according to local media. For this year’s auction, fish wholesalers wore masks and sanitised their hands as they examined the texture of tail meat from fresh and frozen tuna by touching, smelling and sometimes tasting pieces of it. Spectators were not allowed to attend the event, now held at a market called Toyosu after the city’s world-famous fish market relocated there from its old site, Tsukiji, in 2018. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders are expected Tuesday to extend a shutdown in Europe’s top economy as coronavirus deaths continue to mount despite tough restrictions in the run-up to the holidays. After Germany’s daily deaths surpassed the 1,000-mark for the first time on December 30, pressure escalated to slow the spread of the disease which has claimed more than 34,000 lives. Merkel and the premiers of Germany’s 16 states are due to meet Tuesday, with regional leaders signalling that they would prolong the current partial lockdown beyond the January 10 deadline, probably until the end of the month. “Given that infection rates are still too high it will be necessary to extend the restrictions,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said Monday. Michael Kretschmer, premier of Saxony, the state with the highest infection rates in the country, said a continued shutdown was “unavoidable”. The current rules have seen most shops closed along with schools, restaurants, cultural and leisure facilities, and celebrations over Christmas and the New Year holidays were limited to small gatherings. Officials say the impact of holiday travel and socialising on the virus’s spread will not be known until mid-January but that the figures to date are already deeply worrying. More than two-thirds of the 15 million coronavirus vaccines shipped within the United States have gone unused, US health officials said on Monday, as the governors of New York and Florida vowed to penalise hospitals that fail to dispense shots quickly, Reuters reports. In New York, hospitals must administer vaccines within a week of receiving them or face a fine and a reduction in future supplies, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, hours before announcing the state’s first known case of a new, more infectious coronavirus variant originally detected in Britain. New York hospitals on the whole have dispensed fewer than half of their allocated doses to date, but performance varied from one group of hospitals to another, Cuomo said. The NYC Health + Hospitals system, the city’s main public hospital network, has only administered 31% of its allotment, compared with 99% for a few private hospitals in the state. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an even lower vaccine uptake for New York overall, saying fewer than one in five of the 896,000 doses shipped to the state since mid-December have been given. In Florida, where officials have put senior citizens ahead of many essential workers for getting the vaccine, Governor Ron DeSantis announced a policy under which the state would allocate more doses to hospitals that dispense them most quickly, South Korea is requiring that all foreign passengers “must provide proof of a negative #COVID19 PCR test obtained within 72 hours of their departure as well as a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon entry,” according to the US Embassy in Seoul. Japan’s top-ranked sumo wrestler Hakuho has tested positive for coronavirus, the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) announced on Tuesday. Mongolian-born Hakuho, who is the longest-serving yokozuna - top-ranked sumo wrestler - of all time announced via the JSA website that he took a Covid-19 test after losing his sense of smell. Hakuho will now seek the advice of specialists and the other wrestlers in his Miyagino stable will now also be tested, according to the statement. Hakuho’s positive test comes just five days before the sumo New Year Grand Tournament is due to start on January 10. So far, the JSA hasn’t said whether the tournament will be postponed. In May, 28-year-old sumo wrestler Shobushi died due to multiple organ failure related to the coronavirus after he became infected. As of Tuesday, Japan has reported 249,246 cases of coronavirus and 3,693 deaths. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Tuesday told a ruling party meeting a state of emergency declaration for Tokyo and the surrounding area would be decided on Thursday, local media has reported. 2021 has begun in crisis mode for Boris Johnson’s government as it scrambles to control new Covid infections by closing schools and implementing a new national lockdown. Peter Walker reports on the new measures: Here is that notice from the Los Angeles EMS: This is pretty shocking even in pandemic terms. The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency has told ambulance crews not to transport coronavirus patients who are unlikely to survive – in order to conserve oxygen supplies and ICU beds, CNN reports: Los Angeles and Southern California are dealing with one of the country’s worst outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. ICU bed capacity plunged to 0% in Southern California last month, as more and more people were admitted to hospital seeking treatment for Covid-19. Now, many medical facilities simply do not have the space to take in patients who do not have a chance of survival, according to the agency. As of Monday evening, there were 7,544 people hospitalized in Los Angeles due to Covid-19 and just 17 available adult ICU beds, according to county health data. Due to the shortage of beds, the county EMS said patients whose hearts have stopped, despite efforts of resuscitation, should no longer be transported to hospitals. If there are no signs of breathing or a pulse, EMS will continue to perform resuscitation for at least 20 minutes, the EMS memo said. If the patient is stabilised after the period of resuscitation, the patient would then be transported to a hospital. If the patient is declared dead at the scene or if no pulse can be restored, paramedics will no longer transport the body to the hospital. ... A shortage of oxygen in Los Angeles and the nearby San Joaquin Valley, thanks to Covid-19, is putting immense pressure on the system and forcing paramedics to conserve the supply. A Japanese newspaper has claimed that the heads of some of the country’s best-known companies have been “secretly” inoculated against the coronavirus with the Chinese Sinovac vaccine. The Mainichi Shimbun, a daily broadsheet, said 18 unnamed people, including chief executives and members of their families had received the vaccine, which has not been approved in Japan. The newspaper claimed the doses were brought from China to Japan by a Chinese consultant with close ties to the communist party. While the Mainichi does not name the individuals, it goes into some detail about the circumstances surrounding the reported vaccinations, describing how the head of a “major information technology firm” and his wife received a jab at a clinic in Tokyo one Saturday evening last month. The couple, who paid ¥10,000 [£71] for each jab, were reportedly vaccinated by the head of the clinic, which was officially closed for the day. The company president told the Mainichi that he had learned of the vaccinations through personal connections, adding that neither he nor his wife had suffered side effects from the first vaccination and were due to have a second jab three weeks later. The newspaper said the list of 15 men and three women who had received the Chinese vaccine included the heads of well-known financial institutions, electronics makers and IT firms. One of the people told the Mainichi that catching Covid-19 would be “absolutely unforgivable” given his senior position, adding that the jab would enable him to attend business dinners without fear of becoming infected. Ordinary Japanese citizens will have to wait significantly longer to get vaccinated. The government has said that vaccinations of 10,000 frontline health workers will begin in late February, followed by vulnerable older people in March. The vaccine rollout for the general population is not scheduled to begin until April at the earliest, Japanese media have reported. The Nikkei business newspaper said Japan’s prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, had personally intervened to secure enough doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for 60 million people. Japan is also to receive doses for 20 million people from Moderna and for 60 million from AstraZeneca. Suga, who is 72, has said he would “set an example” by being among the first to be vaccinated. Mexico approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for emergency use Monday, hoping to spur a halting vaccination effort that has only given about 44,000 shots since the third week of December, about 82% of the doses the country has received, AP reports. Prior to this, the Pfizer vaccine was the only one approved for use in Mexico. Mexican regulators approved the AstraZeneca shot. Assistant Health Secretariat Hugo López-Gatell said he erroneously reported approval for Chinese vaccine maker CanSino, noting it had not yet submitted full study results for safety and efficacy. Mexico has pinned much of its hopes on the inexpensive, one-shot CanSino vaccine. “It will makes things a lot easier for us,” López-Gatell said. López-Gatell, who heads up efforts to deal with the pandemic, had to explain why he was spotted at a Pacific coast beach, apparently sitting at sea-side restaurant without a face mask on. López-Gatell has repeatedly counselled Mexicans to stay at home. He has also cast doubt on how whether face masks protect people from catching coronavirus. López-Gatell said he saw nothing wrong with going to the Pacific coast state of Oaxaca to see friends and relatives, noting that the virus alert level was lower there. Over the weekend, local media posted photos of López-Gatell sitting in the open-air restaurant, reportedly in the laid-back beach resort of Zipolite, in southern Oaxaca state, which has mandatory rules about face masks. Mexico has nearly 1.45 million coronavirus cases and 127,757 deaths. In Australia, Western Sydney community leaders have blamed low Covid-19 testing rates on the government’s failure to get key health messages out to migrant communities: Veteran talk show host Larry King, who has Covid-19, has been moved out of the intensive care unit at a Los Angeles hospital and is breathing on his own, a spokesman said on Monday. King was moved to the ICU on New Year’s Eve and was receiving oxygen but is now breathing on his own, said David Theall, a spokesman for Ora Media, a production company formed by King. The 87-year-old broadcasting legend shared a video phone call with his three sons, Theall said. King, who spent many years as an overnight radio DJ, is best known as host of the “Larry King Live” interview show that ran in prime time on CNN from 1985 to 2010. The Pacific archipelago of Samoa is tightening its restrictions on access to the country in a bid to keep new strains of Covid-19 suppressed, banning travellers who have transited through 13 countries including Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Canada. Last week, Samoa banned all travellers from Britain and South Africa because of the emergence of the new B.1.1.7 strain. The country has also imposed new testing regimens on citizens returning to the country, and imposed a six-month moratorium on the return of those who have caught and recovered from Covid-19. There are up to 300 Samoan sailors scheduled to finally return home on a repatriation flight later this month. Samoa recorded its first cases of coronavirus only in November, in returned travellers. Elsewhere in the Pacific, Palau - which remains Covid-19 free - has received 2800 doses of the Moderna vaccine, part of the US’s rollout of Operation Warp Speed. Palau’s health ministry said it hoped to have nearly all of Palau’s population vaccinated by April. It has asked for 30,000 doses, which it said it expected to receive in the next three months. Vaccinations of Palau’s most vulnerable have begun. The full story now on New York confirming its first case of the more contagious new UK strain: New York has found its first case of the more contagious variant strain of the coronavirus initially reported in the UK, Andrew Cuomo, the governor, said on Monday. The discovery raises concerns about threats to hospital capacity should it spread rapidly in the state, especially while efforts to get the public inoculated are behind schedule in the US, leading some states to threaten to redistribute vaccines if hospitals don’t get shots into more arms quickly. Cuomo reported that a man in his 60s living in a town north of the state capital of Albany has the new strain. The man, who is recovering, had not traveled recently, suggesting community spread is taking place. The variant has so far been reported in Colorado, then California, then late last week in Florida. In Australia, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has signalled the federal government will assist more than 2,000 Victorian state residents stranded in the state of New South Wales due to a New Year’s Day lockout. In interviews with 3AW and 2GB on Tuesday, the Australian prime minister revealed he had spoken to Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on Monday night about developing a “better pathway home” for people unable to return home before the hard border closure was imposed on New Year’s Day. Morrison said the commonwealth respected the states’ rights to set public health policies including border measures but would help make them as “painless as possible” by identifying Covid-free areas of NSW: And for a break from coronavirus and other news to cleanse this blog... here is a short meditation on narwhals and their bonkers teeth (by me): A group representing major US airlines on Monday backed a proposal by public health officials to implement a global testing program requiring negative tests before most international air passengers return to the United States, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines , United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and other major carriers, also urged the Trump administration in a letter to Vice President Mike Pence “to move ahead with recommendations to rescind current entry restrictions on travellers from Europe, the United Kingdom and Brazil as soon as possible ... concurrently with the testing program.” Airlines are seeking at least 14 days before new requirements take effect and “consideration of inadequate testing and results availability in specific countries rather than a blanket worldwide requirement is also needed,” the letter said. Starting Thursday, Canada will require that air travelers five and older test negative for Covid-19 before arrival. A Wisconsin pharmacist who was convinced the world was “crashing down” told police he tried to ruin hundreds of doses of coronavirus vaccine because he believed the shots would mutate people’s DNA, according to court documents released on Monday. Police in Grafton, about 20 miles north of Milwaukee, arrested the Advocate Aurora Health pharmacist Steven Brandenburg last week after an investigation into the 57 spoiled vials of the Moderna vaccine, which officials say contained enough doses to inoculate more than 500 people. Charges are pending: Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. I’ll be bringing you the latest – and as always, you can get in touch or follow me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. England will enter its toughest nationwide lockdown since March, with schools closed and people allowed to leave home once a day for exercise for at least six weeks, prime minister Boris Johnson has announced as the numbers of people in hospital reach new highs. NHS doctors have compared UK hospitals to war zones. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said that there was clear need for a major intervention to curb the virus, particularly the new variant, because “the NHS in on the brink”. Meanwhile New York governor Andrew Cuomo has said his state has found its first case of the more contagious strain of the coronavirus first detected in the UK, raising concerns about threats to hospital capacity should it spread rapidly. BioNTech and Pfizer warned they had no evidence their vaccine would continue to work if the booster shot was given later than tested in trials. They said the “safety and efficacy of the vaccine has not been evaluated on different dosing schedules”. The European Medicines Agency said the maximum interval between doses should be respected. It said the second dose should be administered no more than 42 days after the first. Brazil confirmed its first two cases of the new variant. A 25-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man were confirmed as having been infected. Thailand’s prime minister urged the public to stay home. Authorities confirmed 745 new infections; the country’s worst daily total and the government declared 28 provinces – including Bangkok – high-risk zones. Singapore said its police would be allowed to use contact-tracing data for criminal investigations. The technology, deployed as both a phone app and a physical device and made mandatory in some places, is being used by nearly 80% of the 5.7m population. The German health ministry considered delaying second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to make scarce supplies go further. According to a document seen by Reuters, the ministry was seeking the view of an independent vaccination commission on whether to delay a second shot beyond the current 42-day maximum. German media also reported that country’s lockdown would be extended until 31 January. Bild reported that national and federal authorities had agreed to continue the existing restrictions, which include the closures of schools, most shops, restaurants and bars. The UK became the first country to administer the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. NHS England tweeted that Brian Pinker, an 82-year-old dialysis patient, had become the first person to be given the jab."
article115,"Euro 2024 qualifiers: England given Italy rematch, Ireland face daunting group",2022-10-09 12:06:02,"['Euro 2024', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport', 'England', 'Scotland', 'Wales', 'Northern Ireland', 'Republic of Ireland', 'Germany']","The draw for the Euro 2024 qualifiers has thrown up a repeat of the 2020 final, with Italy facing England in Group C. There were gasps at the Festhalle in Frankfurt as the former Germany striker Karl-Heinz Riedle pulled England’s name out of the second pot of seeds. On paper, it is England’s toughest qualifying group in more than two decades, with Ukraine and North Macedonia also contesting the two available places at the finals in Germany. Malta complete the five-team group. In part England have been penalised for their shocking performances in the most recent Nations League, which saw them relegated to League B and meant they were absent from the top pot of seeds for the first time since the 2010 World Cup. The double-header against the defending champions represents their first time they have been drawn against one of the giants of European football in qualifying since facing Germany ahead of the 2002 World Cup. Ukraine and North Macedonia are not to be underestimated, either. The fallout from the Russian invasion has forced Ukraine to play their home fixtures in Poland for the time being but they came within touching distance of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup and were quarter-finalists at Euro 2020 before being knocked out by England. North Macedonia also qualified for Euro 2020 and eliminated Italy from World Cup qualifying earlier this year. However, their veteran talisman Goran Pandev will announced his retirement from the game last month. Scotland and Ireland have also been handed daunting assignments. Steve Clarke’s team have been drawn against Spain and Norway, while Ireland will face three former champions in the Netherlands, France and Greece. Wales will fancy their chances of qualifying from Group D, with Croatia, Armenia and Turkey their strongest competitors. Northern Ireland are in Group H with Denmark and Finland. The top two teams from each of the 10 groups will qualify for Euro 2024 along with the hosts, Germany. The remaining three places will be determined by a play-off process based on performances in the recent Nations League. Scotland, as winners of their League B group, are guaranteed a play-off place if they fail to qualify automatically. The draw in full Group A: Spain, Scotland, Norway, Georgia, Cyprus Group B: Netherlands, France, Ireland, Greece, Gibraltar Group C: Italy, England, Ukraine, North Macedonia, Malta Group D: Croatia, Wales, Armenia, Turkey, Latvia Group E: Poland, Czechia, Albania, Faroe Islands, Moldova Group F: Belgium, Austria, Sweden, Azerbaijan, Estonia Group G: Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Lithuania Group H: Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Northern Ireland, San Marino Group I: Switzerland, Israel, Romania, Kosovo, Belarus, Andorra Group J: Portugal, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iceland, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Liechtenstein"
article116,‘Stark contrast’: how Covid pass is helping Denmark open up,2021-05-02 12:11:30,"['Denmark', 'Coronavirus', 'Europe', 'World news']","Outside Forum, a concert venue turned coronavirus test centre in Copenhagen’s university district, the queue was starting to build up before a sunny Labour Day weekend. As he waited, Casper Beckers, 25, was monitoring the WhatsApp group where the night’s festivities were being planned, starting with a board game bar, then cocktails. “It’s huge, such a stark contrast,” he said of the shift since Denmark introduced its coronapas (coronavirus pass) system last month, allowing much of the country to open up. “The bars are all open and I finally get to see people again almost like normal. Last time I was at a bar, it was crowded to a point that I thought it was a little bit irresponsible.” Since 21 April, places such as bars, cafes, restaurants, museums, sports stadiums and tattooists have been open for anyone who can show a negative test result less than 72 hours old, or a completed vaccination, using a coronapas digital certificate. Currently, people have to provide evidence via the MinSundhed (My Health) app, or on a paper printout. At the end of May, the digital coronapas will be released in its final form. It will also be enough for people to be able to show that they have tested positive for coronavirus and recovered within the previous 180 days. Test centres have been set up in every district across the nation, allowing a record 1 million people to be tested last week – about one in every four adults. Many get tested several times a week. Inside the concert hall, Beckers was guided to one of the 60 booths and was out again within 10 minutes. The result was expected to be on his phone in no more than half an hour. This time he had only had to wait for a few minutes, but the queue can stretch to more than an hour (the waiting time can be checked on a website). At the busy Spisebar 20 in the hip Nørrebro district, the owner Tanya-Maria Solskov said the return of her customers has been “amazing”. The only downside was that the different formats used by different test providers made it time-consuming to check documents. “It almost requires us to have an extra person working down here,” she said. “I think they should support us with some extra money, because it’s normally not our responsibility, and we’re already struggling after they closed us down for four and a half months.” The biggest opposition to the passes has come, predictably, from the Men in Black anti-lockdown activists, who have mounted near-weekly protests against Denmark’s restrictions. Stephanie Risum, from the female Mammas in Black wing, boasts that she has been successfully flouting the coronapas requirement, for example by eating at the upmarket Café Viktor the day before without showing a pass or wearing a mask. “You can just say ‘I’m exempted’ and under law they can’t ask you for proof,” she said. For her, the pass is simply a way of pressuring people to take the vaccine. “What they’re doing right now is they are forcing you to take a vaccine that you don’t trust, and we’re not going to do that.” Back at Forum, though, Lindsay Lebensohn, 34, who had taken advantage of the reopening to have her hair dyed a vibrant purple, shared none of these concerns. “We’re going to the Tivoli amusement park today because our kid just finished kindergarten yesterday,” Lebensohn said. “And then tomorrow she’s sleeping at her best friend’s place, so her parents can go out and get wasted.” • This article was amended on 2 May 2021. An earlier version mistakenly referred to Lebensohn having her hair dyed “a vibrant blue”."
article117,Denmark to make loud and clear their love for stricken Christian Eriksen,2021-06-16 20:55:32,"['Christian Eriksen', 'Denmark', 'Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Football', 'Sport']","A little after 6pm local time, Christian Eriksen may well expect the windows of his temporary lodgings to start shaking. He can see Parken, Denmark’s national stadium, from his room in Rigshospitalet and one can only imagine how dislocating it must feel to watch thousands of red shirts funnel through the glorious summer heat while his teammates prepare to face Belgium inside. On the off chance he could not hear the fans before, their noise will resonate loud and clear in the 10th minute of the game: play will stop and they will rise as one to acclaim their No 10 in a show of appreciation, love and sheer relief that he is listening at all. “It is a crazy situation for him to be in,” said Kasper Hjulmand, the Denmark head coach. Eriksen should have been out there doing what he has done since 2010, making his side tick. Until their world turned upside down on Saturday, Hjulmand had been planning something special on the pitch for this one: Eriksen was to play an unspecified new role, one intended to give the Belgians extra food for thought, that the pair had discussed for a month. Now nothing will be as expected and the biggest unknown, with the comparative prosaic matter of retaining an interest in Euro 2020 sitting alongside the emotional outpouring, is exactly how everyone makes sense of it all. Saturday had begun as a carnival. Denmark is newly free of most Covid-19 restrictions and, with flags lining Copenhagen’s most popular thoroughfares, football represented a perfectly timed release. Then came the intake of breath that stopped an entire country in its tracks, Eriksen’s collapse in the 42nd minute against Finland prompting fears of the very worst. The sense of shock was prevalent even when good news about his condition emerged, so Belgium’s visit feels like the moment everyone can exhale as one. “I know both the players and I are taking some great steps after what happened,” Hjulmand said. “We have more hours with good feelings than bad feelings and we are ready to do our best.” Denmark opted to train at their base in Helsingor on Wednesday, but Hjulmand offered his players the chance to visit Parken quietly in the evening and take their time to recalibrate; those who found it helpful could travel there by bus to process the scenes and feelings that confronted them at shockingly close quarters, rather than being overwhelmed upon arriving for the Belgium game. “The reactions will be different from player to player,” said Yussuf Poulsen, the centre-forward. Denmark find themselves in a situation nobody could adequately prepare for. Yet there is an appetite to get back on track: to make this a radiant occasion both by honouring Eriksen and winning. Over the past couple of days, talk around the camp has centred more willingly on football. When the squad trained on Monday for the first time since Eriksen’s cardiac arrest, a sombre mood offered little suggestion anyone was ready for a return to normality and it was impossible not to sympathise with the intense frustration felt that Uefa essentially forced them to expose themselves in deciding whether the Finland game resumed. By Tuesday the smiles had begun to return and Hjulmand was at pains to point out that standard preparations – meetings, video clips, training routines – would not be neglected. The sense is that all bets are off: who could fault Denmark if the occasion simply proved too much, but who would be surprised if they ripped into Belgium and played the game of their lives? This time they will be backed by 25,000 supporters, meaning Parken will be two-thirds full, after an increase from the previous 15,900 was agreed. The sun will be out again; it will be an atmosphere ripe for a happier place in the history books. Belgium will contribute to it willingly. “A celebration for football and for Christian,” was how Roberto Martínez described the event his players will walk into. Romelu Lukaku said Belgium would kick the ball out if they are in possession when the clock strikes 6.10pm. Eriksen and Lukaku, teammates at Internazionale, have swapped messages. “I told him to take his time and if he wants to talk I am always here,” Lukaku said, explaining he will contact Eriksen again after their teams have met. In plain football terms, Denmark cannot afford to lose given all three of their Group B rivals have wins to their name. Belgium beat them twice in the Nations League last year and Denmark will find themselves scrapping with Russia and Finland for progression if they cannot reverse that recent trend. For all the undoubted sincerity of his goodwill, Martínez’s approach will be businesslike; another win would put them in the last 16 and it is a chance to give minutes to Kevin De Bruyne, who has travelled after an improvement in his recovery from a fractured eye socket. But Belgium are not simply coming up against a football team, their tactics, their structure, things for which they can plot and plan. “We’re not only going to play for Christian,” Hjulmand said. “We’re going to play for who we are, our identity and the whole of Denmark who experienced what happened with us. We’re not done with this tournament.” If Denmark can master the intangibles, they might not be. Even if that is a step too far, the din that reaches Eriksen’s ears a few hundred metres away will be joyful enough."
article118,"Girl, 13, likely to have survived if moved to intensive care, coroner rules",2022-03-04 10:00:34,"['Hospitals', 'NHS', 'London', 'Health', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Doctors', 'Sepsis']","A 13-year-old girl who died after contracting sepsis in an NHS hospital probably would have survived if doctors had identified the warning signs and transferred her to intensive care earlier, a coroner has ruled. Martha Mills, from London, described by her parents as “bright, healthy, enthusiastic”, was the first ever child to die at King’s College hospital (KCH) with a pancreatic injury of the type she sustained in a fall from her bike on an off-road family trail in Wales while on holiday last year. She was transferred to the south London hospital because it is one of three national centres for the care of children with pancreatic trauma. An inquest at St Pancras coroner’s court, north London, heard that several opportunities were missed to refer Martha to intensive care, which probably would have saved her life. In an emotional witness statement read through tears, Martha’s mother, Merope, the editor of the Guardian’s Saturday magazine, said that after their daughter contracted an infection on 21 August last year, she and her husband, Paul Laity, raised concerns about Martha’s deteriorating health a number of times but doctors sought to reassure them rather than escalate her care. She said her daughter’s symptoms initially included a high temperature, diarrhoea and low blood pressure. On 25 August, Martha began to bleed heavily through a tube inserted into the upper arm and through a drainage tube. Mills said in her statement that she explicitly raised her fears about Martha going into septic shock over the bank holiday weekend. On 29 August, Martha had high fever, low blood pressure, a racing heart and a rash, which was misdiagnosed by a junior doctor despite Mills voicing her concern that it was caused by sepsis. It was only the next day that Martha was admitted to paediatric intensive care. “I felt that my anxieties about all of Martha’s symptoms, and especially what they might mean when put together and considered in the round, weren’t given proper acknowledgement,” Mills told the court. Two KCH consultants involved in Martha’s care said at the inquest that she should have been in a high-dependency bed – where critical care reviews are routine – rather than on the Rays of Sunshine ward for children with liver and other conditions, well before she was eventually transferred to intensive care. Prof Anil Dhawan said she should have been placed in a high-dependency bed as early as 6 August, 11 days after the accident, while Prof Richard Thompson said it should have happened on 21 or 22 August. Thompson – who was the duty consultant when the rash appeared, though on call at home – nevertheless explained that on 29 August he had decided that escalation was not necessary. Mills said in her statement that she and Laity were “stunned that no member of the critical care team was even once invited to review Martha on the Rays of Sunshine ward. We know that sepsis is unpredictable and septic shock can come on suddenly, with catastrophic results. So we simply don’t, and never will, understand why a ‘take-no-risks’ approach wasn’t adopted … From the episode of her bleeding, it always seemed evident to us that her situation had become exceptional.” Dr Akash Deep, a professor of paediatric critical care at KCH, was asked by the family’s lawyer, Tamar Burton, whether Martha would have been admitted to intensive care had he seen her. He replied: “100%.” Prof William Bernal, who produced a serious incident report on Martha’s death for KCH, said there were at least five occasions when she should have had a critical care review. He wrote that Martha’s chances of survival “would have been greatly increased” if she had been admitted to critical care earlier. By the time of Martha’s transfer to paediatric intensive care on 30 August she had septic shock and was “profoundly unwell … and failed to respond to interventions”. In Bernal’s report, he also commented on the relationship between the consultants looking after Martha and critical care, stating: “It was reported that referrals were made more often and with a lower trigger threshold, and that relations were easier, with the general rather than liver paediatric services. The perception reported was that the liver ward team sometimes questioned the value of review.” The inquest heard that KCH was making changes in the wake of Martha’s death, including improving diagnostics and taking account of parents’ views. The senior coroner Mary Hassell, whose verdict was based on the balance of probabilities, said Martha had been “incredibly unlucky” to strike the bike’s handlebars in the way she did, but it was an injury many other children had suffered without the same fatal consequences. “She was not transferred to intensive care as she should have been,” Hassell said. “All the evidence I have heard boils down to that. I find the likelihood is if she’d been transferred to intensive care, she would have survived.” Martha’s parents said she was “a fun, singular, very intelligent girl, who had such an appetite for life and all its opportunities. She was growing up to be a strong, remarkable woman … We have now had confirmed what we always knew – that this was a preventable death. Martha’s future has been stolen. We feel outraged on her behalf.” Prof Nicola Ranger, the chief nurse at KCH NHS trust, said: “We would like to extend our deepest sympathies once again to Martha’s family for their loss. We accept the coroner’s findings, and on behalf of the trust, I would like to apologise for the failure to recognise Martha’s deteriorating condition earlier, which led to delays in providing appropriate treatment. We are committed to delivering further improvements to the care we provide to patients at King’s.”"
article119,Denmark 0-1 Finland: Christian Eriksen awake after collapse – as it happened,2021-06-12 19:55:29,"['Euro 2020', 'European Championship', 'Denmark', 'Finland', 'Football', 'Sport']","“We are all reminded what the most important thing in life is and that is to have valuable relations.” Euro 2020 Group A: Joel Pohjanpalo scored the only goal of the game in a match that was completely overshadowed by the collapse and subsequent resuscitation of Christian Eriksen just before half-time. Thank you. It’s been a strange evening, dear Reader. Thanks for all your kind messages and Tweets, enquiring after my welfare and providing welcome translations. I am absolutely fine but as much as I’d love to make this all about me, I don’t think it would be approriate. There’ll be a match report along at some point but in the meantime I’ll leave you with this ... Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep! It’s an extraordinary, historic and a momentous result for Finland, whose players will be well aware and completely happy in the knowledge that for all their heroism, this match won’t be remembered for the result. Congratulations to them, their opponents, the match officials, the backroom staff of both teams and the medics, not to mention all those in the stands for all their efforts – some of them apparently life-saving and heroic - on a very difficult and surreal evening in Copenhagen. 90+4 min: Another long ball towards Vestergaard is hoofed clear. It’s all over. 90+3 min: Denmark are lumping it towards the Finland goal and hoping for the best with the game deep in added time. 89 min: Jannik Vestergaard is now playing in attack for Denmark, for whom time is running out. The result of this match is academic, of course. Their only concern will be for their stricken team-mate Christian Eriksen, who is reported to be stable in hospital after collapsing in the first half and receiving CPR on the pitch. 87 min: Finland goalkeeper Hradecky flaps at a cross that sails to the feet of Poulsen. The Dane is unable to react quickly enough to score beforethe ball’s hacked clear. 85 min: Going back to the penalty won by Denmark - I’ve just seen it again and I don’t think Youssef Poulsen was touched before he went to ground. 84 min: Finland substitution: Brentford’s Marcus Forss replaces the goalscorer, Joel Pohjanpalo. 81 min: Brilliant defending from Finland’s Robin Lod, who slides in to hook clear as Jensen tried to connect with a ball squared by Vestergaard in the six-yard box. Jensen takes the corner, which Hradecky punches clear. 80 min: While I was taking care of the replacement admin, Braithwaite failed to pick out Cornbleius with a half-shot, half-cross from the right. 79 min: Danish substitution: Andreas Cornelius on for Thomas Delaney. Finland double-substitution: Joni Kauko and Rasmus Schuller on for Teemu Pukki and Tim Sparv. 77 min: I must confess I thought it was a very soft penalty that would be overturned on review. Referee Anthony Taylor thought long and hard about it before pointing to the spot. 75 min: With the obvious ongoing caveat that Hjobjerg has more important things on his mind at the moment, that was a woeful penalty-kick. He aimed for the bottom right-hand corner but got nowhere near it. Hradecky guessed the right way and saved comfortably. It’s a dreadful effort from Hjobjerg, whose shot is stopped by Lukas Hradecky. 72 min: Arajuri is adjudged to have brought down Poulsen as the Dane chased a through ball into the penalty area from Thomas Delaney. 70 min: Youssef Poulsen finds a pocket of space oin the edge of the six-yard box and leaps to try and get his head to a ball from deep from Braithwaite. It’s a mite too high. 70 min: Danish right-back Daniel Wassd has never scored for his country and looking at that high effort he just sent over the cross-bar from the edge of the penalty area it’s not difficult to see why. 67 min: Denmark’s Mathias Jensen is penalised for clattering into Jere Urenon. 66 min: Danish double-substitution: Jannick Vestergaard and Andreas Olsen replaced Simon Kjaer and Jonas Wind moments after Finland scored. 63 min: On any other day I’d say Kasper Schmeichel should have done better but you can forgive him for being distracted this evening. Pohjanpalo’s header wasn’t brilliant, a downward effort that bounced straight in front of Schmeichel and went past him. The goalscorer wheeled away in celebration before reining in his completely undertsandable basic instincts. 60 min: An already weird match takes another strange turn as Finland go ahead. Jere Urenon crossed from the left and Joel Pohjanpalo got the run on his man to leap and plant a downwards header past Kasper Schmeichel. Finland take the lead! 58 min: Martin Braithwaite canters down the inside left and squares the ball for Jonas Wind. Under pressure from his marker, he’s not able to make clean contact and steer the ball goalwards. It breaks for Thomas Delaney, who sends a shot high over the bar. 56 min: It may have been scoreless in the first half but Denmark were battering Finland prior to Eriksen’s collapse. They’re still dominating now that play has resumed but the game is comparatively sedate. 55 min: Danish left-back Joakim Maehle skips away from Glen Kamara but makes a dog’s breakfast of his shot from distance. 54 min: Teemu Pukki is penalised for a high boot as he comes close to kicking Simon Kjaer in the head while trying to win a loose ball. 53 min: Mathias Jensen has been kept busy since replacing Eriksen. He’s teed up by Hjobjerg but shoots high over the bar from distance. 51 min: Finland captain Tim Sparv is booked for a foul on Yurary (aka Yussuf Poulsen). Jensen’s free-kick from deep is cleared. 49 min: Mathias Jensen takes the set-piece and his delivery is cleared by Paulus Arajuuri, who thumps it away with his head. 48 min: Martin Braithwaite tries to get on the end of a good cross from the right but the ball is intercepted by Jukka Raitala. Corner for Denmark. 48 min: Corner for Denmark. The ball’s swung towards the near post, where Finland clear. 46 min: Play re-resumes after a quick turnaround in what seems likely to be one of the strangest games I’m ever like to provide commentary of a sort on. One thing’s for sure, and I am not in any way trying to be glib, the players of Finland certainly won’t forget their Big Tournament debut in a hurry. Peep! Well, that was ... eventful. The first half finishes scoreless, with the players of both teams having apparently agreed to continue following a long break in play for treatment to the stricken Christian Eriksen, who collapsed and had to receive CPR. He is reported to be stable in hospital, awake and talking. 45+1 min: Finland goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky was kept busy before the break in play and finds himself in possession again, collecting a cross from the right. 44 min: Thomas Delaney goes in hard on Robin Lod, relieving the Finn of possession. 41 min: For better or worse, play resumes with Mathias Jensen on for Christian Eriksen. With Christian Eriksen reported to be stable in hospital, this match is going to continue from the 41st minute at 7.30pm BST. Here’s hoping the players and match officials are all happy with that decision. Their courage is to be commended. Reader kindness: I have received an astonishing number of emails and Tweets from concerned readers (and colleagues) asking how I am in the wake of having to report on the unfortunate events at the Parken Stadium, even if it is from afar. Thank you very much for your concern - I am fine, just a little rattled like everyone else. Wow! In a quite astonishing turn of events, the Danish FA have reported that the game will resume at 7.30pm BST once their players have been reassured that Christian Eriksen is in a stable condition. The last four minutes of the first half will be played, followed by a five-minute half-time break and then the second half. Belgium v Russia will also go ahead. Match postponed: Apologies for jumping the gun a nbit there. The match is postponed but Uefa have yet to officially confirm it. One suspects Belgium’s game against Russia tonight might also be postponed. Again, these are mere administrative trivialities compared to the bigger picture surrounding Christian Eriksen’s welfare . Match postponed: As expected, Uefa have confirmed that the Group B match between Denmark and Finland has been postponed. Uefa update: Uefa have promised an update at 7.45pm (CEST), which is obviously an hour earlier in the UK. They’re already running a little late, which is completely understandable, but it seems absolutely inconceivable that the players of Denmark and Finland will be asked to continue this game tonight. Christian Eriksen has been stabilised but his team-mates, the players of Finland and all present in the stands of the Parken Arena have been traumatised. In no particular order: The medical staff, the Danish players, the Finnish players, the backroom staff from both teams, the referee, his officials and the crowd at the Parken Stadium deserve a massive amount of credit for their individual and collective responses to what happened in Copenhagen tonight. Having said that, I am prepared to give the medical staff a little more credit than everyone else, but you know what I mean, eh? Here’s hoping Christian Eriksen will make a full recovery but for now let’s just be grateful he’s still with us after collapsing and receiving CPR on the pitch. We wish him, his wife Sabine and their kids, and all his friends and family all the very best. I’m reliably informed that this says Eriksen “is awake” and undergoing tests in hospital. Christian Eriksen: It has been confirmed that the 29-year-old Danish midfielder has been taken to hospital and stabilised after collpasing on the pitch of the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen moments before half-time. There are photos of a conscious Eriksen being stretchered off the pitch, wearing an oxygen mask and with his eyes open. Unconfirmed reports suggest that either Eriksen or one of the medics treating him – and hats off to them, by the way – gave fans the thumbs-up as he left the pitch. The Danish FA have just reported that Eriksen is “awake”. Thank God for that. Update: England have cancelled their media duties, as Gareth Southgate and Harry Kane, a friend and former team-mate of Erikssen’s, felt it would be inappropriate to take questions from the press at this difficult time for everyone with a love for football. Some good news. Uefa report that Eriksen hasd been transferred to hospital and been stabilised. Denmark v Finland: There are pictures in circulation from a reputable news organisation, which I have seen but am not going to publish here, that suggest Eriksen was conscious and wearing an oxygen mask as left the pitch on a stretcher. We can but hope they are genuine. There are no official updates on his condition yet. Denmark v Finland: The game has, for the time being suspended and it seems very unlikely to continue this evening. Obviously the actual match could not be more unimportant and everyone’s thoughts are with Christian Eriksen. He has been removed from the pitch on a stretcher and a kind Danish reader has emailed to say he is only 500 metres from the most renowned hospital in Copenhagen, where he will receive the best possible care. Denmark v Finland: I have no further reports to bring you at the moment and I’m not about to engage in idle London-based speculation about what’s going on in a small corner of a field in Copenhagen. My hands are shaking here, so it’s a little difficult to type. I will bring you any confirmed news as it comes. It’s worth saying again: C’mon Christian! Fight! What we know: The ball went out of play for a Denmark throw-in down near the corner flag. Rushing to receive the ball from whoever was taking it, Christian Eriksen collapsed face first into the turf as the ball hit his knee. Two nearby Finnish players, a Dane and referee Anthony Taylor immediately signalled for urgent medical assistance. Soon after that arrived, one of the Danish medical team was seen performing compressions on Eriksen’s chest as his teammates formed a ring around him and the staff treating him. As of five minutes ago, Eriksen was still receiving treatment on the pitch. The BBC have ended their coverage and I’m told the match has been postponed. This is awful. Denmark v Finland: On the BBC, they’ve cut back to the studio and probably not before time. Gary Lineker, Cesc Fabregas, Alex Scott and Micah Richards all look in total shock, as am I. It’s difficult to know what to type here, really. Please God, Christian will be OK. Denmark v Finland: A young woman, who I guess is Eriksen’s wife or partner has made her way on to the pitch and is being consoled by Denmark skipper Simon Kjaer and Kasper Schmeichel. The Finland players, looking very shaken, have retired to the dressing-room. Denmark’s distraught players continue to form a wide circular shield around their stricken team-mate. Denmark v Finland: Christian Eriksen collapsed down by one corner flag near the touchline. His own team-mates and a couple of Finland players immediately signalled to referee Anthony Taylor that he needed urgent medical attention. I think Taylor had spotted that anyway and immediately halted play so the medical staff could come on and work on the midfielder. They continue to do so while the clearly concerned players of Finland maintain a respectful distance on the other side of the pitch. 45+2 min: As the players of Denmark, some of them distraught, form a shield around their team-mate Christian Eriksen while the team’s medical staff work on him, those from Finland are keeping their distance but also look incredbly concerned and upset. The crowd has fallen largely silent. This is truly traumatic for all present at the Parken Stadium. Come on, Christian! 45 min: This is truly awful. Erikssen is being resuscitated on the pitch as his distraught team-mates stand around him in an outward facing ring to shield him and give their teammate and the medical staff looking after him some privacy. He just dropped face first into the ground as he went to receive a throw-in. 44 min: Erikssen appears to be getting CPR on the pitch. Oh my, this is awful! His teammates are standing around creating a kind of human screen to give him some privacy as the medical staff attend to him. I think I can see somebody pumping his chest. 42 min: There’s huge concern from referee Anthony Taylor and the players of Denmark as Christian Eriksen goes to ground. I think he just collapsed and fell over as he went to receive a throw in. This is very worrying. 40 min: Danish right-back Daniel Wass heads the ball straight into the arms of Hradecky after connecting with a cross. Moments previously, Martin Braithwaite had cut inside from the left and shoots well wide. 38 min: Pukki is cutting an isolated figure up front for Iceland, whose plan is to sit back, soak up Denmark’s pressure and then try to hoist the ball his way and hope for the best. Swap Pukki for Burak Yilmaz and it’s pretty much what Turkey tried to do against Italy last night ... a tactic that worked, for a while. 37 min: A Christian Eriksen cross from the right flank is headed clear by Finland. They’re hanging in there but are being outclassed in nearly every department. 35 min: Shaughnessy resumes play with a swab of cotton wool stuck up one nostril. Denmark float a free-kick from deep towards the far post, where Hradecky gathers for Finland. 32 min: finland defender Daniel O’Shaughnessy goes down after shipping a blow to the head, prompting referee Anthony Taylor to stop play so he can receive treatment. He seemed to clash heads with Simon Kjaer. 29 min: For Denmark, Yussuf Yurary tries to get on the end of a curled cross to the far post. Finnish defender Jere Urenon tries to clear it and collides with his own goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who is hardly inspiring confidence in his team-mates. Following a break for medical attention, Urenon is fit to continue. 28 min: Teemu Pukki is flat on his back halfway inside the Denmark half after getting an accidental arm in the face from Andreas Christensen. He seems to be OK. 27 min: For Denmark, Martin Braithwaite finds himself with the ball at his feet a little left of goal but slices his shot wide of the left upright. 25 min: Daniel O’Shaughnessy hurls another long throw into the Denmark box, where Joel Pohjanpalo leaps but only gets a shoulder to it. 23 min: Teemu Pukki gets his first sniff, trying to out-sprint Simon Kjaer and latch on to a long ball. Kjaer holds him back and Pukki gets a free-kick. He was through on goal if he hadn’t been fouled there but Kjaer doesn’t get a c ard of any colour. From the free-kick, Finland get a throw-in. 21 min: Denmark win a corner and Andreas Christensen and Simon Kjaer lumber up from their centre-half positions. The inswinger bounces and sits up nicely for an unmarked Thomas Delaney about eight yards from goal, but he fires over the bar. 20 min: Denmark win a throw-in deep in Finland territory, down by the corner flag. The newcomers clear their lines. 19 min: Christian Eriksen brings another smart save out of Luka Hradecky, who dives to his right to parry a curling shot from distance from the Danish midfielder. 17 min: Nothing comes from the ensuing corner, which Finland clear. They are being completely dominated but haven’t conceded yet. 15 min: Brilliant from Hradecky in the Finland goal, who seems determined to hog the headlines. He contorts himself in mid-air to tip a header from Pierre-Emile Hjobjerg over his own bar. 12 min: Hradecky is called into action again. He plucks a Christian Eriksen corner from the air. Denmark’s players are trying to unerve him, crowding him on his own goal line. 8 min: Finland goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky is having a baptism of fire. He saves a shot from distance from Jonas Wind, moments after fumbling another effort in his own box after some pinball in the penalty area. Denamrk are bossing proceedings in these early stages. 4 min: Finland’s Robin Lod is penalised for a clumsy challenge on Martin Braithwaite and goes in the refereee’s notebook early doors. 2 min: Finland win another throw-in, this time deep in Denmark territory. Daniel O’Shaughnessy has a powerful long throw on him and Delaps the ball deep into the Denmark penalty area. They clear. 1 min: The pre-match formalities between captains Simon Kjaer and Tim Sparv over, Denmark get the ball rolling. Finland win an early throw-in halfway inside their own half, which Daniel O’Shaughnessy takes. Not long now: Referee Anthony Taylor leads the teams out on to the Parken Stadium sward, the Danes wearing their customary red and white shirts, the Finns in navy. Both sets of players line up either side of the team of match officials and it’s times for the anthems. What a moment this must be for the players of Finland. Group A: Wales came from behind to rescue a point against Switzerland in a game they were perhaps lucky not to lose. Ben Fisher was at the Baku Olympic Stadium. Here’s how he saw the match unfold ...

Tim Sparv took time out from his preparations for Euro 2020 to write a guest column for the Guardian revealing what qualification means to him, his team-mates and their compatriots. Tonight’s match officials Anthony Taylor leads an all English judge and jury in Copenhagen tonight. We wish him well, even if the sight of Stuart Attwell on VAR duty is perhaps a cause for concern. Referee: Anthony Taylor Referee’s assistants: Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn Fourth official: Sandro Scharer VAR: Stuart Attwell It’s an exciting, landmark day in the history of Finland as the home of Jari Litmanen, Kimi Raikonnen and Jean Sibelius line up in the finals of a major football tournament for the very first time. Markku Kanerva’s side surprised many across the continent, including plenty of his own compatriots, by finishing as group runners-up behind Italy in qualifying and while little is expected of a team ranked 54th in the world this summer, they will be hoping to bloody a couple of noses now they’ve finally arrived on the big stage. They take on a Denmark side packed full of household names, among them Kasper Schmeichel, Christian Eriksen, Martin Braithwaite and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and managed by Kasper Hjulmand, an interesting character who took up coaching when his playing career was cut short by a knee injury he suffered at the age of 26. They are many people’s idea of tournament “dark horses”. But then so were Turkey and look what happened to them last night. In a huge boost to their chances, Denmark will enjoy home advantage for their three group games and will play in front of 11,250 fans in their 38,000 Parken Stadium. Kick-off is at 5pm (BST) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."
